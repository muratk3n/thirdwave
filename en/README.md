While the list of services Google offers keeps growing, an alleged
violation can single-handedly lock you out of all the services. Over a
month later, multiple closed-without-reply appeals and 2 employees
personally taken a look, I still don't have access to my data"

Bcz back then Dems did not want to help Trump, and now Reps do not
want to help Biden? 

"@GunnelsWarren

We could have had a $1.8 trillion COVID relief bill in October with
direct payments to the working class to help pay the rent and food. It
is shameful that we’re being asked to support a 900 billion bill with
corporate immunity and nothing for the working class"

Pro debt / anti debt... The right answer depends on the
party. Oscillation btw the two will lead to an optimal final IMO, in
the long run..but neither is an illegitimate position. See
[Austerity](2020/07/austerity.md).

There is some good culture / precedent / regulation around DOJ. Like
Prez cant fire ppl directly but appoint ppl who could, in theory? But
then those ppl are hemmed in with regulation, which they can change,
but its hard. POTUS can always fire for refusal of firing others, but
then you get special persecutors jammed up your ass, by the courtesy
of Congress.

US fought a lot with racism, at gov level.. One of the main actions of
the then new Justice Department late 1800s was persecuting Klan
members. Lota Klansmen were sent to federal prisons bcz of DOJ.

Is there "dignity in work" if the work is made-up work and useless?
People shld fight for UBI rather than being paid to dig holes and fill
them back up again.

Plus what is the charge cycle? How many times can the said "efficient"
charge/recharge be done? 4000 times? Then what? Recycle the battery,
having to deal with all that frickin acid.. No thank you.

---

We cant ship batteries easily, their energy density is too low. Energy
needs to be shipped to it. Its misinformed proponents are all about
"the grid" for this reason. But the grid is inefficient itself, so
even combined with "efficient" monkey, the whole system is as good as
fossil.

"We'll update the grid", then we have another problem which is not
enough lithium to go around. Existing reserves can only cover 10% of
today's storage needs, 1% projected. That is one rare monkey.

---

It is too specialized, for one. Widely used systems need to be build
around agile, common components. Batteries are like that circus monkey
performing that one trick very well, but we need a Swiss army knife
not a circus monkey. The animal cld be fine, rare, handles one case
superbly. But how about many other tasks?

"Batteries can store and allow energy retrieval efficiently. What is wrong with that?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
