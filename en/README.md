Used to think 90s was our zenith but 19th century might be it. If you
are in the right geo, good science, exploration, no climate change,
good diet..

Victorian Diet

"Eating onions, cabbage, beetroot and cherries meant 19th century
people were healthier than we are today. [They] were healthier and had
stronger immune systems than us... Also ate wholemeal bread which
contained immune-boosting yeast. Avoided sugar, cigarettes, drank weak
alcohol and did strenuous exercise. They ate onions, watercress,
cabbage, beetroot, Jerusalem artichokes, apples.

You could get a huge bunch of watercress for next to nothing - there
were watercress trains that came into the cities. Cherries were known
as a poor man’s fruit. A punnet of cherries, that you would pay £6 for
in Marks and Spencer's these days, you could get then for a ha'penny
[a coin the equivalent to half a penny]. They ate scraps of meat from
the bone, boiling the bones to get all the nutrients. And fish like
herring, mackerel and cod roes"

Idea: Take fundamental physics up and until 30s. Take the addl
measurements done since (they are fine), and obviously use modern
computing.. I think one can still do some damage in sci starting from
principles of what was known back then, and working it forward

---

I always felt uneasy abt the Big Bang.. not the concept per se but the
fact that it was so far in the past.. With so much of basics
unresolved in fundamental phy, how can you rewind the model and peer
so far in history? To the beginning of time!

Their Rome collapsed first, so they had the experience of the absence
of a centralized power for longer, had a period of diverse
city-states, and there were always other small to medium states near
in Europe, which creates a certain pluralistic environment. They had a
major part in Renaissance, most of that stuff is internalized. That's
why the guinea is better off than my niggers. Otto version of Rome
limped into 20th, blocking dev.

"Italy also has Rome in its past, why arent they in a mess at the
level of Asia Minor?"

Maybe I should just use Glass Ceiling

6th G for race? Genetics? Hah

5G instead of 4G? The fifth G being Gender? That could be better

For all driving, lithium world reserves are soorta enough assuming
half a day of storage. If you take one full day, not enough. Half a
day, plus a swap mechanism, not enough.. This thing has a bleak
future. Thought oil caused wars? Wait to see the wars on this one.

How can I be sure it is 32 kbps? I checked them with `vnstat`. 

---

I have streaming URLs, listen to them through `mpv`. They are all 32
kbps, that is kilobit per second, one of the lowest xfer rates but
still with good quality.

That tactic wld work on a lot of people, not just the "uneducated"
BTW. I see a lot of young ppl ignoring this part of politics, having a
naive belief in people wisdom. Voters fall for spin, lies, get led one
way or another, all the time. Know the game so u can lead them
better. Obv Im glad Dems did better job at it than Reps this time.

How did Biden neutralize Trump strengths..? On China for example.. Ads
said Trump was weak on China, sold out to China, it was repeated
during debates. To Trump!

Pol experts wld know this is not true.. but the mere fact that it is
said, raises doubt, creates oppo to sell.

DW had an excellent documentary the other day on diet, sugar in
foods.

Will that uploaded to their archives? It had Raj Patel, talked abt
Coke in Mexico, etc.

Anyone watching that would be more scared of American Coca-Cola than
the American military.

---

Cornel West also talked abt the neofascist threat... it's not like
this is news in the left.

TBH most of this stuff is not even scifi worthy. How many times have
seen a black hole in a movie, TV show. "Time dilation field near it
duuuude"... potentially all fking bollocks.

---

You could certainly focus on QM and have some fun there but I was
wondering if they were effing shite up at large scale first.. and they
were. No big bang? No black holes? All this dark matter, dark energy
stuff is in question? Man o man...

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
