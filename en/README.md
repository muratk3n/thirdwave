One rotation can supply two households for a day. W-O-W

'Back of envelope' calculation shows on a windy day the #HaliadeX 13
MW #offshorewind turbine produces 24hrs x 13,000kW = 312,000 kWh. In
one day the rotor turns c.11,000 times, yielding 27.8 kWh per
rotation. Double the amount of energy that a typical UK household
requires daily

They used to say about Oliver Stone that "in his movies, it's like he
is standing by your ear with a megaphone, and yells at you what to
think". If those crits saw the bizarre Trek shows they'd never
complain about Oliver Stone ever again. In comparison OS is the
motherblinking grand bleeping master of subtelty.

The gentlest crit directed at such shows from our side has been "they
are not painting an optimistic future". I dont think that does justice
how badly these shows suck. The backdrop of *Firefly* was pretty drab
but everyone likes the characters, stories. No these weird shows lean
on an artificial message to insert agenda.

Yep, that's the guy, co-destroyed Trek

"The Silence of the Lambs becomes another bland procedural... *Clarice*'s
other co-creator is Alex Kurtzman, a practiced IP hack known for
Transformers, various Star Treks, a failed Mummy, and the worst
Spider-Man. That's a lot of money made off other people's
originality. Can't we institute some kind of limit on this stuff, like
maybe a person can only work in four pre-existing universes per
decade?"

Obviously ppl blame Renzi for crashing the coalition; but what did
this guy did not get that he wanted? In repr democracies with
coalitions, small parties like his can be kingmakers. FDP played that
role in Germany for years.

You can still do journalism wout being physically at a place, all the
time; just watched a Renzi interview, Channel 4 asked good questions.

The thrift / deficit decision is a political one, so by definition it
cannot be de-politicized, taken out of realm of discussions, turned
into some kind TINA law, just like Bitcoin "not printing money",
depoliticizing that decision disqualifies it as a national / global
fiat currency.

"Should autsterity be embedded in European law?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
