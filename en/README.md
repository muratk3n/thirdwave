UK population is 67 million, world is 7.8 billion. With same level of
driving, what wld be the amt of lithium required, just for cars, for
the world?  You do the math. I wont bcz I know the answer will be so
hilariously sad.

---

Ahaha.. this gets even more fun the more you look into it...

UK drove 303.7 billion miles in 2013. Let's say all their cars were
bitch BEVs. Take miles driven daily (need to store that at least),
with range 250 miles per 75 kwh bat, and 60kg of lithium per 70kWh,

```python
mday = 393e9 / 365.
print ("%d tons" % (mday / 250 * 60 / 1e3))
```

```text
258410 tons
```

Only UK wld require a quarter million tons of lithium. This is for
**one country**, just for **driving**, nothing else. World reserves
are a mere 17 million tons ü§£ ü§£ ü§£

He is UK based it seems.. Is he getting some love from his gov? Guy

Bill David on ammonia.

"[04:24] Because in 1908 and 1910, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch managed
to produce ammonia.  And they used nitrogen from air, and they used
hydrogen from water 100 years ago to do that.  And nowadays, we have
170 million tons of ammonia produced each year.  And it's principally
used for fertilizers.  And the statistic is that about half of the
world would go hungry if we didn't have ammonia, if we didn't have
artificial fertilizers"

"[04:52] 40% of the nitrogen that sits in your bodies, that sits in my
body, has actually made its way through the Haber-Bosch process"

"[05:31] But I guess very few of you will know this next piece of
history.  Because this is 1943.  And this, to me, is an absolutely
magnificent story.  It's the middle of World War II.  The Belgians
have actually run out of diesel.  It's been appropriated for war
purposes.  And their bus fleet grinds to a halt.  This is in November, 1942.
In May, 1943, the bus fleet was up and running with a mixture
of ammonia and hydrogen, running the bus fleet tens of thousands of
kilometers accident-free in the middle of World War II"

"[07:03] [W]e've managed to take a combination of sodium and sodium
amide.  And that's actually basically cracking the ammonia,
decomposing that ammonia, as well as the best ruthenium catalysts"

"[7:30] In a reactor not much bigger than AA bat, we got 30 Watts power
out of it, enough to power a television"

"[13:46] But I want to say that there's actually
a bigger level, a bigger moonshot that we can aim at.
Because ammonia already provides food for half the planet.
When you combust ammonia, when you use ammonia
in a fuel cell, what comes out at the end is water.

So we've got food.

We've got water.

I've talked about energy.  And in fact, what ammonia can do is it can
contribute to a bigger issue, a bigger dream of contributing to the
food, water, energy nexus"

@H2Europe

Plug is forecasting sales of 1.2 billion dollars and an operating
profit of $200 million after the \#acquisition of United \#Hydrogen
Group Inc. and Giner ELX.  Over 50% of the \#hydrogen it uses will be
green by 2024 according to its goal.  \#HydrogenNow @HydrogenFC

I see..

Stark Ark reactor outputs 3 gigawatts

Trek TNG Enterprise generates 12.75 billion gigawatts (from *True Q*)

Cool to be in the future! (Or even in today's fi).

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
