Finally a purer Linux phone (Android is Linux too in a way, it has L
kernel inside but with layers of crud on top)

OS is open source

All apps on it downladable from its app store are open source

You can *phsically* shut off it camera, Wifi, and Bluetooth. There are
physical slide buttons for it.

The battery can be removed.

I WANT IT

Jacobin: "Neoliberalism Is Driving Away Working-Class Voters of
Color. They Need to Be Won Back. Last month’s election was a mixed
bag. Yes, Joe Biden got 12 million more votes than Hillary Clinton
did. But Donald Trump added 9.5 million votes of his own. More than
half of those new Trump voters — 4.6 million of them — came because he
increased his share of nonwhite voters from 21 percent"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
