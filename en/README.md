"Missile purchase prepares [Oz Defence Force] for Taiwan
contingency.. This week the government announced that it will invest
$1 billion in outfitting the Navy with new missile capabilities to
‘project and maintain sea control’ as tensions over Taiwan heat
up.. In a press release, Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said the
[Royal Oz Navy] will get 'leading-edge long-range anti-ship missiles,
extended range surface-to-air missiles, advanced light weight
torpedoes, and maritime land strike capabilities with ranges in excess
of 370 kilometres for anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, and 1,500
kilometres for maritime land strike missiles.'"

Slamming GS.. usually not seen at this level.

NatSec Jake Sullivan: "We’re not about trying to make the world safe
for multinational investment; we’re about creating jobs and raising
wages here in the United States.  So our priority is not to get access
for Goldman Sachs in China; our priority is to make sure that we are
dealing with China’s trade abuses that are harming American jobs and
American workers in the United States"

[Ph.D. is about depth](2011/10/phd-graduate-studies.md), not breadth.
The joke is "A PhD knows more and more about less and less until he knows
everything about nothing.". But then, there is some of everything in that nothing
:), so you'll have learned a lot, at the very least develop brain
muscles for that depth. It is also about adding something new in the
field, not merely knowing more, its not "undergrad times 10".

"I want to get a PhD. Should I?"

From [The Mathematical Reality Why Space and Time are an Illusion](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Reality-Space-Time-Illusion/dp/B0849ZXQB1):
"As early as the 1930s, the Dutch physicist and close friend of
Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, wondered why the wave functions for matter
(complex numbers) and light (vector fields) were mathematically so
different. The importance of this profound question is still
underestimated today. If one follows the mission to explain natural
phenomena in a unified picture, light and matter must be contained in
a single formalism. This means that there has to be a mathematical
object that on the one hand, must be a little more complicated than
vectors and complex numbers, but on the other hand must incorporate
their properties...

Hamilton..  one of the most brilliant mathematicians of all time
.. started to study complex numbers. If it was possible to define a
multiplication in two dimensions in such an amazing way, was it also
possible in three dimensions?... On 16 October 1843, while walking
along the Royal Canal in Dublin, Hamilton finally came up with the
answer. In three dimensions it was indeed impossible; but at that
moment, he realized that the tricky multiplication of complex numbers
could be transferred to a four-dimensional number system called
quaternions that had three imaginary units $i$, $j$, $k$ instead of
just one $i$. Whether Hamilton could already have imagined the
fascinating rotations that occur in this number system, we do not
know. In any case, overjoyed at his idea, he carved the constituting
equations into a stone of a nearby bridge

$$
i^2 = k^2 = j^2 = i \cdot j \cdot k = -1
$$

... If we come back to the philosophical question of what mathematical
structure could potentially describe all physical phenomena,
quaternions are a strikingly simple possibility. Since they contain
both complex numbers and conventional vectors as a subset,
quaternions, in principle, can represent all the number systems
physicists have used in their description of the elementary phenomena
light and matter"

No, encouraging useless work just so people are employed is a
no-go. That might equal pollution, ppl doing weird shit bcz they are
small entities, hard to regulate in the many.

Than maybe there'll be less [stubble burning](https://www.dw.com/en/india-pollution-how-a-farming-revolution-could-solve-stubble-burning/a-51166417)
and less smoke blanketing the capital city.

If fewer f-ing farmers implies less smoke, than that option is a good option.

"New farm law will mean fewer farmers in India"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
