I was rooting for the other guy but apparently it is right's turn

"Voters in Ecuador appeared to turn to a conservative businessman in
Sunday’s presidential runoff election, rebuffing a leftist movement
that held the presidency for over a decade marked by an economic boom
and then a years-long recession"

That's a load of bullshit

It's like Israelis. The Jews didnt "leave" the region, they converted and
[they stayed](2020/06/10-myths-israel.md). Leaving is hard, ppl usually dont.

Galatians 1st century are my people, as are everyone before and after
there. The current make up of Anatolia is composed of their
descendants and little of later arrivals, like some punks from
Punkbuttfuck from Central FuckFuck.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
