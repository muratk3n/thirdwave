... The child tax credit in the Rescue Plan is a basic income for
children. It'll cut child poverty in half. IN HALF!!! The word
'historic' is overused but this seems very very historic to me"

Actually Dem div indirectly caused Rep division later.  If everyone
stuck one side, -ism, none of that wld happen. Had to happen this way
I guess..

Divisions Trump trig'd at the Reps remind me of Clinton triangulation
with the Dems. At the time Reps probably enjoyed that, seeing the
in-fighting on the other side (until BC started encroaching on their
shit, then they panicked). What goes around, comes around, a kind of
division hit them too in the end.

She just kept betting on tech, TSLA etc.  People thought this was some
kind of genius but all they did was betting on tech when it happened
to be doing well, when it was time for tech (growth stocks). When the
situation **turned** they could not see it coming. Their playbook had
one page. They were like that broken clock showing the right time once
a day.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
