They wouldnt do it for that, no. U dont eff with an US admin that
way. If they did it, they probably did it to help the good cop / bad
cop routine by providing the bad cop part of the act.

upcoming Biden admin to make piece with Iran"

Why so many Rep pols showed loyalty to Trump election claims? Bcz they
knew claims wld go nowhere, and there are still bunch of his followers
in their districts, so then the question is when the shitshow ends,
what do you want those ppl remember you by? As the jagoff who knifed
him, or sorta stood by, repeated some bogus shit along with many
others, than "celebrated democracy" after it was all over.

I toyed with vitamin idea for fruit substitute, then I thought, how
can you pull fruit's water and reduce it in size? Well that's
jam. That too can be DIY, just like pre-cooking poultry.

Captain Cook brought pickled cabbage with him to his voyages, he'd
have tons of this stuff, and eat it. His crew would turn their nose at
his cabbage, and he'd laugh at them, bcz he knew it kept sickness at
bay.

Testing new diet. Veg container, poultry cont, meal takes from each,
cont holds 4 servings. Freeze storage, taken out as needed. Breakfast,
fruit jam plus cheese (feta-like, cow-goat, high calcium).

Poult can be turkey, red meat (diced not minced), cooked w onions, all
water boiled away. Same for veg, different kinds of cabbage (a very
underrated veg).

All natural, except perhaps jam, but that too is as natural as
possible.

Storage + mobility are key. Also w some gourmet effect. Stuff tastes
good (onions, sauce preserved on meat, add water while heating, it's
great).

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
