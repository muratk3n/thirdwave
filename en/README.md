"In the past 10 years, there has been a new trend in wind power:
harvesting the energy of high-altitude winds. At 1000 m altitude,
winds are about three-times faster than surface winds... Furthermore,
high winds are steadier and available almost all over the world,
unlike surface winds which are intermittent and only exploitable in
certain areas of the globe"

Moscow criteron.. 

"[About UK doctrine 'Moscow criteron'] It has been the UK’s policy
that the independent British nuclear deterrent should be able to
defeat ballistic missile defences around Moscow. If the UK decided
alone to take the apocalyptic decision to use its nuclear weapons, it
would want to be able to target large centres of population such as
Moscow. Hiroshima and Nagasaki would be dwarfed by such events. The
rationale for this policy is that our independent deterrent has to
cover the possibility that, if the US decided for any reason not to
use its nuclear capability to defend Europe, the continent and the UK
in particular could defend itself"

NYT: "In the early days of the pandemic, when drug makers were just
starting to develop vaccines, placing orders for any of them was a
risk. Wealthier countries could mitigate that risk by placing orders
for multiple vaccines and, by doing so, tied up doses that smaller
countries may have otherwise purchased, according to experts.

As a result, most higher-income countries were able to pre-order
enough vaccines to cover their populations several times over, while
others had trouble securing any doses at all"

Why did it take so long for the EU to even consider RU vax? Was US
blocking this?

No it is no necessarily a constant descend for gliders.. there are
"thermals" hot pockets of air rising, if they catch one of them they
can climb. Ride enough of them they can keep going and going..

Dude broke hang glider distance record, 368 km, that is flying
uninterrupted in a single day, clocking in 40 km/h on average.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
