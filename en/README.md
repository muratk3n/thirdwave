The [Old Deal](2021/05/farmers-foragers-fossils.md#olddeal.md).

- The "benevolent king / rulers" who is "kind and just" to its
subjects narrative of the agro age cements the status of both.

- Religions, philosophies rose up to challange the status quo, and
they were swiftly coopted.

Here's what you can get under 100k in Brooklyn. None of the four
listings are actually homes. The 100k listing is a PARKING SPACE. The
2,600 one is a shared medical office for rent. The other two are
vacant lots. Happy house-hunting!"

What is being "commemorated" is always related to what the nation
wants to do in the future.. In that war Oz offered manpower due to its
[quid-pro-quo](2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.md#australia) for
naval protection with the UK. That's how Oz soldiers ended up on the
other side of the planet. The same need exists today, albeit with a
different naval power, US, so the nation "commemorates" to keep that
memory fresh in case similar sacrifice might be needed in the future.

"Australia commemorates the Anzak Day for their WWI losses in
Gallipoli. Why?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
