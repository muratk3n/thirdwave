Forbes: "In July 2020, Microsoft tested hydrogen fuel cells for backup
power at its data centers. This move aligns with its commitment to be
carbon negative by 2030 and eliminate dependency on diesel fuel by 2030.
While still in the exploratory stages of using fuel cells as
backup generators, the company hopes to scale the 250 kW system to a 3
MW system, which is equivalent to diesel-powered generators currently
at its data centers...

When comparing levelized costs for a completely resilient, 100%
renewable data center with zero emissions, hydrogen is 119 dollar/MWh,
while batteries could be over 4,000 dollar/MWh to ensure 48 hours of
backup power [.. from Jack Brouwer, a professor of mechanical and
aerospace engineering at the University of California, Irvine]"

Yes. And inflation risk is a major risk for bonds / treasuries, the
pricing of which reflects the market's perception of future inflation,
and indirectly growth (growth => rising wages => more money in
circulation, inflation). 

"Inflation will also affect interest rate levels. The higher the
inflation rate, the more interest rates are likely to rise. This
occurs because lenders will demand higher interest rates as
compensation for the decrease in purchasing power of the money they
are paid in the future"

Automation can do wonders.

"Manufacturing Robots Speed Wind Farm Construction... Denmark has long
been a world leader when it comes to renewable energy. In 2019, the
country set a new record by sourcing a massive 47% of its electricity
consumption from wind power alone. Today, manufacturing robots from
Danish company Odico are set to revolutionize this pioneering industry
even further"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
