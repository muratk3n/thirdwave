"Every time we think we've measured our capacity to reach a challenge,
we look up and we're reminded that capacity may well be limitless!"

Yeah the old man didn't give a flying f--k about globalization, to put
it mildly. Technobabbling, style-over-substance centrists missed that
part too.

---

I wrote about globalization, way back when, that it wasn't all that is
cracked up to be... It didnt fit the theory, so it was left out. Then
I noticed an overemphasis on it, so I hit it. I saw a few squeak, I
laughed at a couple, but that was pretty much it. The feeling is
largely like you are some jagoff mumbbling nonsense in a corner...  It
wasn't fashionable at all to write that stuff. I never thought, in my
wildest dreams, any anti globalization policies, thoughts, anywhere
coming to fruition within my lifetime.

Its very [national narrative and identity](2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.md)

"What is constructed wrong in TR?"

Dem centrists are in a sad state.. Their liberal hero dying on them,
and a con being paraded around as replacement in the last second was
the last straw IMO. They are being beaten down, until the very
end. The progs, as far as I can see, are being nice to them.

The new anti-glob left-right combo (if fascism, very lite compared to
WWII standards) brought a certain trolling with it... They make light
of known aspects of good governance. And why not?  If a superpower in
the 21st century cannot give free healthcare to its people, after
decades of promises and grandstanding, shouldnt they be trolled? Or in
UK, through papers, denying left, as "left", invading a country, as
right diddling on EU then "asking" the people, having that blow in
their face, some trolling is called for? Or in TR basically doing
nearly everything wrong? They made an ass of themselves, and they
deserved what followed later.

On one of those cruise ships which experienced the epidemic in an
isolated environment, they found about 30% of the people were
infected. We can assume the virus reached everyone possible on that
ship. 30% of 3% is nearly 1%. So if given the chance, covid can kill
millions in US alone, similarly in other countries.

"Fatality / Cases ratio gives 3%. But how about overall mortality
rate?"

I am not in the business of influence peddling. Blog will say what I
consider to be beneficial. Cannot temper the message to have say in
policy even if that was possible. Dont veer away from the suggestion
bcz of style reader, it'll be your funeral, and not my problem.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
