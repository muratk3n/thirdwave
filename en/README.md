.. Like every global automotive OEM, GM understands that 'electric'
vehicle refers to the motor not a battery. Despite \#energytwitter
aspirations, massive EV adoption is a 2030-40s story. OEMs see
\#fuelcells benefits on supply chain risks/complexity, cost-to-mass,
cost curves"

The classic Gnome desktop actually started giving problems on new

I posted this before, [here is](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2020/07/github-pages-for-math-code.html)
in article form, how to publish code and math through Markdown / Github.

The thing abt the Mustache book is I dont think it is written with
malice in mind. There are passages in there showing a public servant
kind of bummed he couldnt help a President. "Things cld have been
setup to expediate this and that.." Sad. But also what u get when u r
an outsider.

Diamond inher is a coding thing, as in "inheriting" code, but through
multiple paths, the graph looks like a diamond

---

Yesss C++.. Mmm hm... I was the C++ f-ing master in my time. I ax you
a diamond inheritance interview question, you'll go into a epileptic
shock

---

Chrono coding setup through Py actually looks like a pain. I might
just do this through C++.

Oh yeah... knock it down bruh!

3D physics simulation... Chrono looks good

Woolsey lines on SG Atlantis crack me up. Writers wrote him as this
last-word freak, stuck-up, busy body suit, and it's really funny.

Well that'll work for sure

It does seem like US can / does fight for ideology. I know there are
other explanations too, but it fought for ideology three times so
far. The Civil War on slavery, WWII was a left leader fighting
fascists, Cold War was a rightist leader fighting communists.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
