"@gabriel_zucman

According to the latest available statistics, US multinationals book
53% of their non-US profit in the main tax havens.

The 2018 tax reform has had no detectable effect so far on profit
shifting.

A country-by-country minimum tax of 21% (as proposed by Biden) would
make a big difference, since it would remove the incentives to shift
profit to very low-tax places"

No

"Should the left make coalition with libertards?"

---

Instead of ultra-right freaks, these libertard guys are somewhat
preferable. If they can become less pro corporate sluts, more pro
small biz, then there might be hope for US right yet.

That of course also partly rests on the left acting left. As long as
Dems encroach on their shit, sit on their couch, watch their TV, eat
their cheetos, they'll never act like a sane party. Then Dems will
spend another quarter century wondering why the GOP is so intractable,
and does not allow them to be "bipartisan".

Nothing special abt 9-9, I picked it so it rhymes.

But then later I checked the date, and there were a lot of Tea Party
protests that day. :)

This guy is still tea-partying like it's 9-9-2009.

Sirota: "Disengaging and going back to brunch is a formula for a
repeat of 2010 and 2016 ..

Sending money to sham groups like the Lincoln Project for them to
light it on fire or use it to set up a conservative media outlet is
destructive â€” if you want to pitch in resources, give it to a news
organization doing journalism that holds politicians accountable.

Run for an office in the 2022 election â€” and donâ€™t be afraid to run in
a primary against a Democrat who is part of the problem"

Ah of course.. random projections do preserve distances.. (it's true,
mathematically provable). why not use that to generate a spatial hash?
Project to smaller dim, bucket, that's your hash. This is LSH.

Noone from CFD seems to be doing this tho.. Probably the approach got
siloed.

"@AlexGabuev

Today's deal announced by Putin, @presidentaz & @NikolPashinyan in
many ways addresses core Russian interests in the conflict, and is
perhaps the best outcome (at least in short term) Moscow could get out
of the situation. ...

Russia has put its 2000 peacekeepers in NK [Nagorno-Karabakh] -
something that Moscow wanted to do back in 1994, but was unable
to. There will be no Turkish armed peacekeepers, which is very
important for Moscow. ...  Presence of the [RU] peacekeepers (in
Moscow's view) is a guarantee that [AZB] will not be tempted to resume
the war and capture all of NK territory. The Kremlin is sure that
@presidentaz took note of what happened after shelling of [RU]
peacekeepers in 2008 in South Ossetia"

Clear message from a coalition of Senators.

"@SenBobArchuleta

My colleagues and I have drafted a letter to @CAgovernor Newsom to
ensure that as we move towards our zero emission goals that we do not
become overly-reliant on or overly invested in one single technology"

The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud"

From the movie *Serenity*

"If youÂ can't do something smart,Â do something right."

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
