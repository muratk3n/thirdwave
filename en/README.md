It is beyond scandalous Netanyahu is handing out vaccines to Czech
Republic, Honduras, Guatemala, and Hungary, related to their opening
diplomatic offices/embassies in Jerusalem. Netanyahu is doing this on
own and is not gov policy-all the while Palestinians not being
vaccinated"

The magic of `plt.savefig('%04d.png' % i)` and `convert -delay 30
*.png anim.gif`. This book had its code depend too tighly on
`vpython`, after many versions failed. Trick above makes it work
again. Simple.

Republicans now pushing a 'work requirement' for child tax credit for
poor families. Funny, when they slashed the inheritance tax, I don't
remember talk of a 'work requirement' for billionaires' kids"

Case in point

"@rebeccaballhaus

When Texas deregulated power generation—creating the system that
failed last week—it required 60% of consumers to buy power from retail
providers, rather than a local utility. Those consumers paid $28B more
since 2004 than the utilities’ rates, WSJ finds"

Too many pro-market types not seeing the monopoly, rigged playing
field problem. You can fashion yourself as the hunter in the
wilderness, aaall free, independent, fine.. But no hunter would go
into a woods where the trees were magically being shifted around, and
game appears and disappears at a whim.. How come is this missed?  For
a self-reliant folk, they dont come across as too alert

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
