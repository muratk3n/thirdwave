So the electric grid is 40% efficient (reducing the overall efficiency
of BEVs, 60% x 40% gives 24%, making it closer to a fossil fuel
powered car). One might ask, how efficient is a gas pipeline? It's
over 97%. Loss in that scenario is a bug, not a feature, you plug the
leaks once found, the normal operation you send molecule from one end,
you expect to receive it on the other. The H2 pipelines, when
finished, will have the same characteristics.

But it all helped US in the end; von Braun worked in the V-2 program,
but after the war, him along with dozens of DE scientists were brought
to US through the operaton Paperclip, and with the help of VB the US
landed on the Moon.

.. which pushed the development of the V rockets. Amazing tidbit of history. 

"The Versailles peace treaty limited the German army to 100,000 men; it
was forbidden to have aircraft or antiaircraft guns, or field
artillery of more than 3-inch caliber. This may explain why the German
army took an early interest in rocket development; the treaty of
Versailles didn't mention rockets at all"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
