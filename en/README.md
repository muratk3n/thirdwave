And there is that.. but change is good. Fingers crossed.. hopefully
Pals will die less this time. Even that would be an improvement, right?

Haaretz: "The Palestinians believe a Bennett-Lapid government would be
'extreme rightist' and 'no different' from Benjamin Netanyahu, a PLO
official said"

As long as gov is central, concentrated, maximized, we need similar
institutions in scale that can take them on..

Assange story shows, MSM wasnt insterested, and bcz they weren't, ppl
werent either. 

There is still a filtering mechanism, and they are at the center of
it. At least in the developed world where media isn't completely sold
out.. We want them to be better of course.

G. Greenwald: "I remember [Assange] telling me the story that he
learned very early on which is when Wikileaks would get documents they
would put them on the Internet they wanted the entire public to be
made aware of them, and they would then contact journalists at the New
York Times the Washington Post, The Guardian, BBC and they would say
we have this incredibly explosive document sitting here, on the
Internet .. and no one was interested in it because they didn't think
it was exclusive..

That was why Wikileaks began partnering with the media in the Snowden
case when Edward Snowden came to us .. precisely because we weren't
part of the establishment press, but we realized .. that if we didn't
partner with long large media outlets it would be very easy for the US
government to demonize and stigmatize us as something other than
journalists. They would say we were hackers we were activists they and
so .. we partnered, and did the story with The Guardian, Laura did
hers mostly with the Washington Post some with Der Spiegel, and even
the New York Times and it gave a measure of protection.

So when I got this material in Brazil, and remember this is four
months after Bolsonaro got inaugurated, this huge right-wing movement
took over the entire country, he was at the peak of his power, we
didn't know what he was capable of doing in terms of press freedom. He
had sworn over and over that he would usher in dictatorship era
repression and I knew we needed the buy-in of the large Brazilian
media or we would easily be depicted not as journalists but as
criminals, especially since I'm not a Brazilian citizen despite living
in this country for 15 years.. we were able to partner with Folio of
Sao Paulo which is essentially the New York Times of Brazil the
largest newspaper in in the country"

An established media channel isn't just about a building, offices, HR
department.. they are a collection of skills, capabilities,
institutional memory, and mentorship around such. That Goldman Sachs
whistleblower for ex.. G. Smith, I read the book.. says he went to MSM
for his tell-all. They have resources to follow up, checking if this
guy is real. who can do that? John, Jane, Greg, mentored by Dave,
whatever. Greg is out, will send Jane. If not John.  How is the random
TikTok jagoff going to handle that? No institution, no nothing. It's
just one guy dancing

Run the microcosmic orbit.. small heavenly cycle. Do the inner smile 

"@MicrobiomDigest

Just got another legal threat, now for my criticism of the "External
Qi" papers. In those papers, a Qigong Master claims to treat cancer
cells with his force. The lawyer representing the authors demands me
to take down my Pubpeer postings"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
