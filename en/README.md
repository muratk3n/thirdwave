Texas has so many additional taxes that its burden is actually higher
than California's for middle-class people. California's taxes on rich
people are significantly higher than Texas. That's actually why GOP
commentators whine about CA taxes"

He makes too heavy use of knowledge abt / around black holes - which
don't exist.

Cant improve stuff while relying on garbage. As a software saying goes
"garbage in, garbage out".

"Eric Verlinde also attemps to explain dark matter"

Newton didn't have any deeper insight into why the laws are the way
they are. He tried bunch of stuff, certain formulas worked better (on
data) than others. That's it. With what we know now, with more
experimental data, and other areas of sci, you could surely modify
Newton.

"How is it possible to modify Newton's theories?"

Go for it. Dont worry if it has mismatches with early universe
theories.  Scientists have no idea what the f--k is going on there

"Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a hypothesis that proposes a
modification of Newton's laws to account for observed properties of
galaxies. It is an alternative to the hypothesis of dark matter in
terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently
understood laws of physics"

That number is global estimation of all reserves, currently used or
not. So this Nevada place did not expand the total, it is within the
total. The lithium is still insufficient. 

"You said lithium reserves are at ~17 million tonnes and are not enough
for green energy consumption. There, they found some new in Nevada"

"@gabriel_zucman

Refusing international coordination is not a sustainable position: If
the UK (or any other country) refuses to apply a minimum tax, then
other countries could simply collect the taxes the UK chooses not to
collect

Sometimes all it takes to shift a conclusion is modifying one
underlying assumption.. It's true modern world is based on many little
pieces coming together and there usually isnt enough time to question
every piece otherwise u cant move forward.. But for a certain kind of
analysis, u have to be able to - else, no progress.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
