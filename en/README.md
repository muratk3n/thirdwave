People are fickle, mostly stupid abt politics, they only care abt
themselves -- which is fine, representetive democracy works just fine
this way.

So understand..? No. UK electorate could have 'understood' WWII
situation and vote for the guy who won it, but they
didn't. Churchill's ass was grass.

The decision for a candidate is in general terms, a combo of 'how am I
doing', 'do I like this guy', and 'did he stay too long'. 

"Shouldn't people 'understand' that there was a pandemic which
effected econ and not care abt the GDP fall, still vote for Trump?"

"@drvox

Herman Cain mocked masks & mask mandates. Then he went to a Trump
event with no masks, caught the coronavirus, and died. We shouldn't be
insensitive -- there's nothing funny about it -- but we also shouldn't
ignore the fact that ..  ignorance is getting people killed"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
