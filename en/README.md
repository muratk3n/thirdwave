Jobs in a renewable fuel economy? Of course there will be jobs... I
dont personally give a flying flap about full employment, only that
people have money and health insurance (not the same thing), but a 10
TRILLION $ worth green economy would imply a lot of jobs.. How can
economic activity that large involving a physical product not generate
jobs?

Due to their handling of covid some of the "magic" around China's
"good governance" story started to wear off.  They acted in childish
ways, and showed the world that a country who is not accountable to
their citizens, through some kind of ballot / electoral process can
actually be a danger to the entire community of nations.. The freak
experiment that is their system needs to end, at the very least,
evolve drastically.

That's probably the message aimed at too; coalition management.

NT: "We have a giant deficit. They [Libya] have a lot of oil. Most
Americans would choose not to engage in the world because of that
deficit. If we want to continue to engage in the world, gestures like
having oil rich countries partially pay us back doesn't seem crazy to
me"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
