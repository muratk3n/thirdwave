"@CGHollins

\#HR1 is one of the most important bills in history, as it will help
more U.S. citizens to participate fairly in our democracy. The Jim
Crow filibuster in the Senate will almost certainly stand in its
way. Will Senators have the courage to kill the filibuster and save
America?"

"The sweeping democracy reform bill has been top of the list since
House Democrats first took back the majority in the 2018 midterms and
immediately set about expanding voting rights and getting money out of
politics.

There‚Äôs a lot of ground covered in its¬†nearly 800 pages, but some of
its key points are creating a national system for automatic voter
registration, putting in transparency requirements for political
advertising, and instituting nonpartisan redistricting commissions to
end partisan gerrymandering"

Man.. they really want Sarko gone don't they? Whenever there are hints
for another run, courts jump on him. I dont know whether they have
something solid but were holding back bcz he is ex-Prez but rerun
makes them reveal stuff, or it is more action-reaction style
punishment, just raw, wanton hammering a politician they dont like.

They come across as a pro-Trump outfit.. Somewhat shady, and not

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
