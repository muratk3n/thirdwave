One cld monkey around with storage ratios etc and say 'barely enough' but
that doesn't cut it for battling climate change. We don't have time to
waste on band-aid, marginal solutions.

Who da muck is this jackass lecturing ppl on guns, etc. DO you know
better than Ronald Reagan? The man made a living of off guns (played a
cowbow right?), then he *was shot* by an actual gun. He certainly knew
more about guns than you. And he was for gun nut, was for gun
control. Ronald F@#$ing Reagan - the founding father of modern
conservatism.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
