TR is beaten by MEXICO. Mexico, with all its problems with drug
cartels is better off.. But then again, according to some recent
revelations TR is becoming a major drug center of her own.

Innovators go out, coke dealers come in.

The solution isnt "more people", or importing bunch of f-ing morons
from abroad, with their chicken coops and shit, in a crooked trucks...
The truck hits a bump and the chicken jump "bwak bwak bwak bwak! bwak
bwak bwak bwak!"... stuff like that.

Must aim for quality.

GDP Per Capita fell for TR dramatically, a trend since 2013. Probably
coincides with degradation of its democracy. WB API doesnt have
numbers for 2020, but most state it did not get better. Some estimates
even place the current number to be around $7000. Sad.


```python
from pandas_datareader import data, wb
import pandas as pd

dat = wb.download(indicator='NY.GDP.PCAP.CD', country=['TR','GR','MX'], start=2010, end=2020)
df = dat.reset_index()
df = df.sort_values('year')
df = df.set_index('year')
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
df2 = pd.concat((df[df['country']=='Greece'],\
                 df[df['country']=='Turkey'],\
                 df[df['country']=='Mexico']),axis=1)
df2.columns = ['c1','GR','c2','TR','c3','MX']
print (df2[['GR','MX','TR']].dropna().tail(3))
df2[['GR','TR','MX']].plot()

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
