This is what we get when the base tech is solid, as in simple,
efficient; Options multiply.

When the base is wrong, like batteries, then it's about limited
resources, coups, cretin, inbred, half-brained celebrities running
amok selling snake oil.

a.k.a Oz Chief Scientist. Have questions? Ask Finkel.

The moderator was more low-key, the previous guy had too much flash,
he is the ambush guy, the griller, which is fine, but his style could
raise tensions somewhat (again ok on my end but most didn't like the
last debate for its tone).

Well near the end there Biden did say "transition".

I don't understand why Trump thinks 401k performance is a winning
issue for him; most 401k holders are the top 20%, "resistance", brunch
liberal types, and they will never vote Trump.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
