How do we know there has never been a civilization as advanced as ours
before? Sure, ground shifts, soil moves can cover a lot of stuff. But
earlier civ would have left something detectable by us, like our
Arctic Storage. I am sure that thing has some kind of radio
transmission to advertise itself, which would have been picked up by now.

"After years of underplaying soft threats like disease and climate
change, national-security establishment faces calls for a new
approach. ... Former senior intel official: 'China, Russia, Iran, &
North Korea get the most resources & attention. If those are one, two,
three, four, this is 372 [on the priority list, the official said of
pandemics]. Itâ€™s that far away.'"

This era will go down as one of the weirdest f-ing times in human
history.

Patriarchy didnt start with religion. It started with organized
[agriculture](2017/10/foragers-farmers-morris.md#patriarchy).  And
agriculture started around the Medi. Ground zero. Root of all ills.

Yeah, I have a feeling carbon storage should be in a rock; not
requiring special storage, and wont melt away easily. Basalt sounds
good.

"Basalts Turn Carbon into Stone for Permanent Storage ... Scientists
have shown that mineral carbonation can permanently capture and store
carbon quickly enough and safely enough to rise to the challenge of
climate change. ... In carbon storage experiments tied to geothermal
power plants in Iceland, 90% of injected carbon dioxide (CO2)
transformed into minerals in just 2 years. Standard carbon storage
methods can take thousands of years to do the same"

Why should gov official read posts like mine? Bcz there is no
institutional culture around what we do, just a guy typing away
somewhere. I have no need to fit into a particular news cycle, and
that can be a problem for the official who needs to roll with that
cycle. There could be a nuke crisis somewhere, but the lone writer
could be talking about weirdest things, venting on between bouts of
screaming away, jumping up and down... Gov needs steady, and they wont
be served by the unstructured chaos that is the net publishing.

That's not to say publications with net origin will not become the net
WaPo or NYT. But when they do they should / would have an
institutional structure, some culture, delibaration. It wont be bunch
of posters sitting around in a circle beating off and typing whatever
comes to their mind.

90s vs 00s/10s scifi differences? During the 90s the enemy was "out
there", out in space, through the gate, in a different galaxy, or no
evil but just natural phenomenon, like a meteor or the Sun itself --
*Stargate*, *Trek*, *Independence Day*, *Sunshine*.

00s/10s scifi is more desparate, evil is at home, people are being
exploited by other people, and the victim / heroes are increasingly
extremely young, just kids mostly. *The Maze*, *Hunger Games*, or the
Deviant series.. *Ender's Game* has the enemy as alien, but the wars
have gone to child level, which is sad. Surely the book predates the
aughts but they must have picked that book to base a movie off of for
a reason.

*Allegiant*, good scifi.

Michelle F looks much better in BSG. In TNG she was freaky thin. Now
got little more mature, her ass filled out, looks primo... I dig it.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
