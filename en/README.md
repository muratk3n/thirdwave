I bet Biden ordered the carrier group weeks ago into SCS to coincide
with this meeting.

I connected them dots.. Wa-poosh ðŸ˜‰

Aha.. USS RR was near Japan, my map's data was a month old. So it
sailed to SCS

NYT: "Even as NATO leaders met in Brussels, the American aircraft
carrier Ronald Reagan and several other warships moved into the
disputed waters of the South China Sea, with the groupâ€™s commander,
Rear Adm. Will Pennington, vowing to protect 'international law and
rules-based order,' wording that echoed NATOâ€™s communiquÃ©. Hours later
[.. CH] conducted their own show of force over waters south of Taiwan,
the island democracy that China claims as its own. Only days before,
the Group of 7 leaders, meeting in Cornwall, England, had for the
first time issued a statement on Taiwan"

Data can be noisy or missing (report delays, etc); so you try to piece
it together from clues. An aircraft carrier (code CVN) never travels
alone, it is accompanied by destroyers (code DG), and guided missile
cruisers (code CG). So CG and DG presence can indicate a larger deployment.

---

Presence around South China Sea is more visible, on both ends, near
Japan, and Vietnam / Singapore.

---

Added a few more destroyers to the Navy location map, and guided missile cruisers.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
