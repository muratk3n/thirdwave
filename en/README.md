Didnt QE say about the 2008 crisis 'it's awful - Why did nobody see it
coming?' That sounds like she is not someone who likes to remain
up-to-date on matters, but *has* to remain up-to-date.

What is more surprising to me is *how come this wasn't known before*?

"Now we know that the mysterious ‚ÄòQueen‚Äôs consent‚Äô is more than just a
procedural formality, it must be scrapped.. The anti-democratic
potential of the consent process is obvious: it gives the Queen a
possible veto, to be exercised in secret, over proposed laws"

Intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines must be suspended

"Former world leaders urge Biden to waive COVID vaccine patents More
than 170 former world leaders and Nobel laureates say waiver is key to
ramp up global vaccine production. At the current rate, the world‚Äôs
poorest nations will have to wait until at least 2024 to reach 'mass
immunisation', the signatories, which included former UK Prime
Minister Gordon Brown, ex-French President Fran√ßois Hollande and
Muhammad Yunus, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
