The hilarious part is C will happily let you do it. What-ever. Coding
close to the metal.

Cast everything to `void *`. Then cast that anything else,
anytime. Wanna dance with the devil boy?! Do it!

Centrist Dems and some Reps like Newt merely used the mystique of tech
to justify undoing of social services. "We cant give healthcare to
people". Why?  "Well, smart sensors, knowledge economy, blah
blah". 

3W methodalogy always stressed how tech, especially a different breed
of tech (post-industrial) will cause *social disruption* unless it is
handled, i.e. proper structures are formed around it. Tech by itself,
in the grander sense, will create more problems than it solves.

They didn't think of any of that. Did anyone talk about the downside?
Any related talk was cleverly steered towards hyperboly,
next-to-zero-chance type events, such as "AI apocalypse", so everyone
could slap themselves in the back and say they thought of "all
angles". "We've got that covered, you see, we are talking about the
dangers of tech". The flare having gone off, they could now go their
marry way to slut themselves to corporations.

From the song *The Unpossible*: "We have the word impossible, but we
need to differentiate between two sorts of things. The impossible is
that which by definition can never be done. We need another word:
unpossible"

As per policy I'd just insert H2 / NH4 FC tech in there somewhere. Say
"it's for long-range", "for steel". Once it is cemented for
anything, it will destroy everything else in the long-run, bcz using
the same tech for everything has other benefits, training, deployment,
maintanance etc. Alternatives will go to the way of Betamax.

The prevalence of the self-help lit during the 90s had to do with
over-commercialization of everything. Life was about "the market",
everyone working "for the market". Then, by implication, if something
bad happened to you, u felt down, it was all your fault. *You* failed
the market. Personal income disrupted for a few months and u get hit
with an health insurance bill of thousands pushing you to bankruptcy?
Your fault. You didn't have an "up personality", could not "crush
it". The guy with the big teeth will tell you how.

Rahm Emanuel presided over the suppression of a video of a police
murder of a teenager, then left office in disgrace to become a Wall St
exec. He’s billed as an honorable Democratic statesman. Meanwhile,
Medicare for All proponents are called 'grifters.'"

"The conflict between the haves and have-nots also feeds into another
major theme of cyberpunk.  Often depicting future dystopias where
megacorporations wield more power than governments, and rule the world
from lofty skyscrapers, overlooking the streets where cyberpunk heroes
try to make ends meet doing illicit jobs, either for these
corporations, or against them"

*Bladerunner* bombed when it came out? Makes sense; I never liked it
as a movie. It might have been influential on other directors, but, as
a movie on its own wasn't all that great. *Star Wars* in the 70s was
both, cinematically influential and a movie people would like.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
