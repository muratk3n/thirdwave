Beckley, *Unrivaled*: "The U.S. military ... can sink Chinese ships
and submarines virtually anywhere in East Asia. The main reason is
that the United States has dozens of missile-armed submarines that are
almost invulnerable to China’s notoriously weak antisubmarine
capabilities. In wartime, U.S. submarines, with the aid of America’s
vast undersea surveillance network in East Asia, could set up picket
lines near the combat theater, or near China’s ports, and sink China’s
ships and submarines with torpedoes, missiles, and mines.  According
to estimates by the RAND Corporation, in a PLA invasion of Taiwan,
eight U.S. submarines could destroy almost 40 percent of China’s
amphibious ships as they attempt to cross the Taiwan Strait while
losing perhaps one submarine. The same study estimates that in a
conflict in the South China Sea—where the sea is deeper and provides
U.S. submarines with better acoustics and more room to operate, and
where most of the PLA’s meager antisubmarine warfare forces cannot
reach—U.S. submarines could destroy Chinese ships at almost no risk of
being attacked themselves"

Yes and the solution wasnt a 'global approach'. Global pharma had to
be bslapped, its patents open-sourced. Global travel had to be
curtailed early, and fast.

CNN: "The world is in the midst of its worst Covid crisis so far. It
didn't have to be this way"

So many econs see this thing as vile..

"Charlie Munger calls bitcoin 'disgusting and contrary to the
interests of civilization'"

Watched Russian scifi, dude's backstory was that he fought in Syria,
felt like those Vietnam backstories in US movies.

Cinematography was ok.. it was too tac-team heavy for my taste. There was a
odd looking alien at the end.

The Guardian: "[NZ] prime minister has been coming under pressure from
allies to take a tougher approach towards country’s largest trading
partner. New Zealand’s differences with China are becoming “harder to
reconcile,” the prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said... Ardern’s
comments were made as New Zealand’s government comes under increasing
pressure, both internally and from international allies, to take a
firmer stance on concerns over human rights abuses of Uyghur people in
China’s Xinjiang province. Last week, the Act party presented a motion
for New Zealand’s parliament to debate whether the treatment of
Uyghurs in Xinjiang constitutes genocide"

Blinken: "China is acting 'more aggressively abroad'... Washington was
not trying to 'contain' China, US State Secretary Anthony Blinken
said, but warned that Beijing was acting in 'increasingly adversarial'
ways"

Cons nominated a lackluster guy for next elec, passing over the better
candidate Soder. In any case S will probably still be around so he can
be the 'comeback candidate' later

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives slipped to a 14-month low in
a poll published Sunday, further behind a Green party that’s
increasingly poised for a bid to lead Germany’s next government

The list of BEV problems keep piling up, not even BEVtards can
ignore. Not enough lithium in the world, barely enough for cars
assuming certain charging patterns.. And, they cant handle freight
properly. Forget aviation, or shipping which this bitch tech cant even
touch.

It is ridiculous. 

"A battery-electric 40 ton truck with 500km range needs 8 tons of
battery. That’s ridiculous" says Toyota’s FCV-boss Katsuhiko Hirose.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
