"[T]he Government of Canada ...  has identified hydrogen as a critical
part of its path towards achieving the goal of net-zero carbon
emissions by 2050, affirming that the development of low-carbon
hydrogen is a strategic priority for Canada over the next 30
years. This ambitious strategic blueprint for the development of the
hydrogen economy seeks to position Canada as a world leading exporter
of hydrogen by 2050. The Strategy outlines Canadian specific business
opportunities and challenges, recommends the use of a mix of
feedstocks (water, natural gas, petroleum, biomass), as well as
industrial by-products available in various regions of Canada to
produce hydrogen"

So it is likely covid came from lab, not animal

Reshare, Feb 2020: "According to Professor Luc Montagnier, winner of
the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for discovering HIV as the cause
of the AIDS epidemic together with Fran√ßoise Barr√©-Sinoussi, the
SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that was manipulated and accidentally released
from a laboratory in Wuhan... in order to insert an HIV sequence into
this genome, molecular tools are needed, and that can only be done in
a laboratory"

"Coronavirus Likely Came From Animal, Not Laboratory, WHO Says"

Carlson, *Ship of Fools*: "Chavez led the legendary Delano grape
strike, which lasted for five years and inspired college students
across the country to wear 'Boycott Grapes' pins.

Chavez‚Äôs signature rallying cry, 'Si, se puede!' ('Yes we can!'),
became so famous among well-educated liberals that Barack Obama used
it as a campaign slogan when he ran for president. Growing up in
California, I can‚Äôt remember a year when we didn‚Äôt celebrate the life
and achievements of Cesar Chavez in class.  Chavez‚Äôs name is still
everywhere in the state. There are six libraries, eleven parks, half a
dozen major roads, and at least twenty-five public schools in
California named after him, more than George Washington. That doesn‚Äôt
include the many Cesar Chavez academic buildings, student centers, and
at least one college. Cesar Chavez Day is a California state holiday.

Most enduring is Chavez‚Äôs 'Si, se puede!' Wherever left-wing
demonstrators gather, you‚Äôll hear it. It‚Äôs most common at
pro-immigration rallies. Several times I‚Äôve seen illegal aliens scream
it while carrying Mexican flags. Every time, I say a silent prayer of
thanks that Cesar Chavez is long dead. It would have been torture for
him.

Cesar Chavez didn‚Äôt support illegal aliens. Chavez didn‚Äôt like
immigration at all, generally, especially the low-skilled kind. Chavez
understood that new arrivals from poor countries will always work for
less than Americans"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
