So tired of hearing Pfizer didn’t get money from the Fed’s when they
got a 1.95 Billion [dollar] 'advance purchase' agreement. Soooo, yes
they damn well did get federal funding and because they had $2bn of
free cash they could go nuts on R&D knowing they already pre-sold 100m
doses"

It feels like every DIY tuber uses the same goofy background music
while they make stuff.

Not sure whether RCEP is good or bad for the respective middle-classes
of all those RCEP countries, but the exclusion of US is strategically
significant.

US obviously pulled out of the TPP with Trump.

Perfect timing too with US being in a funk.

US excluded!

"RCEP: Asia-Pacific nations sign world’s biggest trade pact. The
China-backed RCEP deal excludes the US and will account for 30 percent
of the world’s economy and population"

I can see how some HKers can fall into "expat nationalism". HK folk
aren't exactly expats (from the mainland) in the usual sense but some
could see themselves that way. And a lot of expats overseas who "left
the country and always plan to come back one day" do confuse their
nostalgia with analysis, since they dont live in the "home country"
either, they do not see all that's going on inside, so develop a blind
romantic attachment. Could be the issue here.

People dont like Jackie Chan anymore in Hong Kong? I was wondering abt
that, JC's bio sounded like he could devolve into a Chink nationalism,
and apparently he did.

"Trump [has] largely achieved their goal of choking off the flow of
unauthorized immigrants into the United States — especially families
from Central America, many of whom come with the intention of
requesting asylum. ....

But the coronavirus has given the U.S. its most robust tool yet for
repelling asylum-seekers. An order signed by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in March ...  prohibited the entry of
unauthorized immigrants from Mexico in the name of public health. The
order gave border agents the authority to simply expel them. In the
months since, 200,000 migrants have been expelled, either to Mexico or
to their home countries. None have been given the opportunity to
request asylum or explain why they believed they would be persecuted
if they returned to their homelands.

The combination of international agreements, health concerns and new
tactics has effectively shut the border. So far, none of the elements
in the administration’s new 'waterproof fabric' have been overturned
in court or become the subject of public uproar, as family separation
did in 2018"

TR was late in congratulating Biden. Diplom fail or a childish snub?

Theo James is a good lead. *How It Ends* was a perfectly watchable

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
