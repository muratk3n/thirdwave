The Google v Oracle ruling will be hugely consequential for software
development. Even if the Supreme Court finds fair use, that may be
small comfort for startups that can't afford to litigate to protect
their right to reimplement APIs

Building of a floating platform. Foam is surrounded by concrete,
further supported by steel. Foam supplies the low density (gives
volume minus weight), conrete makes sure the water never gets to it,
hardens the structure, and steel makes everything even stronger. Solid design.

"War [as in culture], as rhetoric, emphasizes the clash rather than
the cause. If you can move the conversation toward the war itself, you
might give people permission to forget why the battle is being waged
in the first place. And you might be able to shift the terms of the
discussion away from the sweeping failures of the federal government
and toward the familiar reductions of the culture war. You can erode
the matter down to the basics of 'personal responsibility' versus
'governmental intrusion'"

Design around the shortcomings. No system component is perfect.

Dont put them into a ward then.

"False positives [from quick tests] can .. put people at risk [??]: If
a virus-free nursing-home resident with a false positive is placed in
a COVID-19 ward, that person could become infected"

Just the flu

"Weâ€™ve seen very healthy, young, athletic, strong people get COVID-19
and die, or end up with long-term disability,' says Akiko Iwasaki, a
Yale immunologist. College athletes have died from the disease. Some
long-haulers, who have dealt with months of symptoms, were marathon
runners and martial artists who have since struggled to walk up
stairs'"

Hence my ed proposal. Scale: cheap labtops, digi content. Repeatable
quality: vid of genius teacher, same in Beverly Hills or Compton.

All abt speed, scale, repeatable quality.

Cheese has the 9 essential aminos. So wont need beef for that. But
cannot completely go animal free (yet).

Poultry storage, messy, need a fallback replacement. Looking at
legumes, sold dried (not canned). Soak, blender, burger. Freeze
storage.

No computer system from Anatolia made the cut? HPC software doesn't on
donkeys my friend.

Not too shabby, but to put it into perspective, Russia held 1688
trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves as of 2017.

"Zohr gas field.. is an offshore natural gas field located in the
Egyptian sector of the Mediterranean Sea.. The total gas in place in
30 trillion cubic feet"

Convert it to H2, I might be fine with it.

Top hardware is deployed looking for fossil shit. 

"According to the TOP500 list, HPC5 is the sixth most powerful
supercomputer in the world, the highest ranked in Europe and the
overall leader among non-governmental systems... The performance level
of this computer means it can use extremely sophisticated in-house
algorithms to process subsoil data. The geophysical and seismic
information we collect from all over the world is sent to HPC5 for
processing. Using this data, the system develops extremely in-depth
subsoil models, and on the basis of these, we can determine what is
hidden many kilometres below the surface: indeed, this is how we found
Zohr, the largest gas field ever discovered in the Mediterranean"

Not just powerful enough, RPi can *be* desktop out-of-the-box.

Take the SD card (with OS on it), stick it in. Connect RPi to HDMI
monitor. Connect USB keyboard / mouse. Boom! Right there, you have now
a desktop environment, welcoming you. User can click on icons, use
spreadsheet, edit programming languages, view videos, right away! All
through a tiny, light board.

"You say RPi can replace desktop machine. Do you mean it is powerful enough to do that?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
