Because it took longer than normal to count the votes, there is the
impression that the results were close. As @zbyronwolf points out-
@JoeBiden‚Äôs victory was much more decisive than you think"

CNBC: "An $11 trillion global hydrogen energy boom is coming. Here‚Äôs
what could trigger it... Storing fuel in salt caverns isn‚Äôt new, but
hydrogen‚Äôs growing role in decarbonization has revitalized interest in
the concept.

The Advanced Clean Energy Storage project in Utah aims to build the
world‚Äôs largest storage facility for 1,000 megawatts of clean power,
partly by putting hydrogen into underground salt caverns. The concept
is quickly gaining momentum in Europe.

Some 130 miles south of Salt Lake City, engineers are working on what
will become a giant cavity in the ground. It‚Äôs a geological formation
known as a salt dome, a column of salt surrounded by sedimentary
layers, and when it‚Äôs filled with hydrogen, it could become one of the
largest renewable energy reservoirs in the world"

The historic wildfires that devastated California this year have
highlighted concerns about climate change and how to make our society
sustainable. The state aims to source all its power needs from clean,
renewable energy by 2045, and Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said sales of
new gas-powered passenger cars and trucks will end by 2035. Under a
roadmap approved by the state regulator, California will need nearly
25 gigawatts in new renewable capacity, including some 8,900 megawatts
of storage, by 2030. The Utah project could help meet those targets.

Thats funny..

Simulation can be a whole new type of business domain. Any
manufacturing company, before manufacturing anything, can ask these
guys to run simulations on the parts they will produce before they
produce them in bulk.

There is always action on many things in US on pretty much everything,
being at the center of research, but the Kraut, and the French, and
the Aussies always seem to have a foot in the door, in those same
fields. Brits too of course.

Swell.

These guys are good..

"We then attempted to replicate these observations with a quick SPH
simulation. The flow field in the simulations and the experiment are
in satisfying agreement. The matching flow patterns indicate that the
fluid dynamics at the higher speeds are reproduced with certainty as
well"

They can increase renewable use through solar, they certainly have a
lot of direct sunshine.

Min says solar generation is done for 6 hours, 1/4th of a day -same
guesstimate I'd used earlier-. For renewable storage; [GenCell](2019/07/gencell.md)
is local right?

"@mnd1103

@JRubinBlogger with all due respect, this is a terrible piece. Ky
Democrats have run 6 moderate candidates in a row against McConnell,
each less inspiring than the previous & losing every time. @Booker4KY
is inspiring & genuine. Unless @AmyMcGrathKY can become both, it‚Äôs a
loss.

Fossil energy companies can win in a renewable fuel economy (there
wont be a 'battery economy' as the amount of lithium reserves are
limited). But many companies have the know-how to transport, process
chemical fuels, they only have to adapt to a somehwat different type
of fuel. This is a win-win for all.

Guess what, Japan is [ready](https://youtu.be/5ejL65tKsGM?t=107) for that shit. 

"Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, last month shipped the
world's first shipment of "blue" ammonia ‚Äì produced using hydrogen
derived from fossil fuels and capturing the carbon emissions ‚Äì to
Japan, to be used in zero-carbon power generation"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
