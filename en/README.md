"Australia and Japan inch closer towards landmark defence agreement...

The successful conclusion of a long-awaited Reciprocal Access
Agreement (RAA) between Japan and Australia promises to elevate
bilateral security and defence cooperation to a new level, according
to Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide. Consisting of a legal
framework to enable two-way visits for personnel and assets from both
countriesâ€™ armed forces, Suga and his Australian counterpart, Scott
Morrison,Â announcedÂ that broad agreement had been reached during a
joint press conference in Tokyo on 17 November. It would be Japanâ€™s
first RAA since the Status of Forces Agreement signed with the United
States in 1960"

"[Certain software] is slow because of the overhead of delegating
geometric operations to polymorphic C++ methods. Abstraction prevents
simplification and optimization, in this case"

Religion is closer to left; it's always been so.. Jesus was a poor
worker, Moses escaped from pheoroah's (the richest man of has age)
opression, Mohammad escaped from the burgeoise of Mekka to Medina,
and had to fight them.

Prosperity gospel..? God wants to you be a billionaire? A lot of this
stuff is Cold War politics.. While fighting against "Godless"
communists, it cld have made tactical sense to ally with religion this
way, through odd cultish branches that preach religion in a certain
way.. But the larger political reality has changed.

Just found out there is a back-story to 'get to the choppa'. Way
before that, he says 'we make a stand now, or there will be nobody left
to go to the choppa', *then* it's 'go to the choppa'.

*Predator* 1987, good movie.

Taibbi: "News companies hate stories about inequality for a variety of
reasons, but especially because theyâ€™re a bummer: advertisers know
images of deprivation and suffering depress the urge to buy, which is
why we typically donâ€™t see poverty on TV unless itâ€™s being chased by
police. Hard to sell Buicks to guilt-ridden audiences. There are
larger political considerations: the ideology underpinning most modern
news coverage assumes poverty is the fault of the poor"

"@SecPompeo

Despite our warnings, Turkey moved ahead with its purchase and testing
of the S-400 system from Russia. Todayâ€™s sanctions on Turkey's SSB
demonstrates the U.S. will fully implement #CAATSA. We will not
tolerate significant transactions with Russia's defense sector"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
