Gone are the days when Churchill was shitting bricks trying to involve
US in European / UK affairs. Now u can't get rid of them!

This thing keeps running in circles doesn't it?

Four senior congressmen write to Boris Johnson to reiterate there will
be no US-UK trade deal if the legislation to override the EU-UK
Withdrawal Agreement isn‚Äôt pulled"

H2 is the only clean storage solution that can do that - drive a
vehicle for long periods of time and even provide its excess power in
emergency to others.

I really don't understand people who move from computational science
to machine learning.

Homer talked abt Troy ppl thought it was bullshit, but a researcher
found it based on Homer's clues. Maybe Atlantis mentioned by Plato is
real too.

Dude. Plato. Total scifi

Let's say divergence. [Here is](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/octave-Faddeeva/scripts/general/divergence.m)
one possible numerical implementation. We see WTF it is doing,
calling `gradient` bunch of times, which is also numerics, and
sums. Let's show that.

---

Plus numerics. How did we ever teach these courses without their
corresponding numerics..? I am not talking about one API call, I am
talking about their core implementation methods.

Now supplementing Denis Auroux.. Multivariable Calculus.

Sorry, had to do it - its curl expl sucks.

Okay.. first they need to change the name, so the acronym is better,
not HAVOC.

I propose **L**andfree **A**irbor**N**e **DO**me - LANDO.

(Per PBS Space Time [video](https://youtu.be/gJ5KV3rzuag?t=327) reference,
Lando was the leader of a floating city in *Empire Strikes Back*? Haha)

3D travel is key, for any planet. Even for Earth. Maybe even for
habitation on Earth?

NASA: "High Altitude Venus Operational Concept

The upper atmosphere of Venus, with similar pressure, density,
gravity, and radiation protection to that of the surface of the earth,
is relatively benign at 50 km. A lighter-than-air vehicle could carry
either a host of instruments and probes, or a habitat and ascent
vehicle for a crew of two astronauts to explore Venus for up to a
month. Such a mission would require less time to complete than a
crewed Mars mission"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
