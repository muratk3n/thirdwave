After Lee Smols, who is the second in command? I need a number
two... I watched some of Cortez, some Cohen, all seem to be singing a
slightly different tune... I need that hipster peppy, young scientist
bursting with energy doodling some shit.

"Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton,
director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama,
president of Harvard, and Chief Economist at the World Bank, wrote a
post-Christmas editorial for Bloomberg entitled, 'Trump’s $2000
Stimulus Checks are a Big Mistake.' It’s a classic"

Latest inequality, Gini [calculations](2019/05/stats.md#gini) with the latest data

```
2020-04-01    0.463
2020-07-01    0.460
```

There was slight decrease in the last quarter. Let's hope the trend
continues, the Dem Prez reduces it faster, at the very least the
damage done during Clinton years are reversed.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
