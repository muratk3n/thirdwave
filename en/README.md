Democracy worked well.

"As the the Biden transition picks up steam, what started as early
sighs of relief with Klainâ€™s appointment has ballooned into a
pronounced endorsement of Bidenâ€™s initial selections to lead some of
the highest-profile positions in government, with progressives giving
the president-elect a hat tip on the delicate balancing act of
appealing to both wings early on"

One thing that I will legitimately appreciate during the Biden years:
the diminished likelihood of news breaking when youâ€™re having dinner
with your kids and trying to get them bathed and in bed"

"Jim Ratcliffe, Britainâ€™s richest man, is joining forces with Hyundai
Motor Co. in a bid to give hydrogen fuel cell vehicles the boost they
need to become more mainstream.

Ratcliffeâ€™s Ineos Group will explore opportunities to produce and
supply hydrogen to Hyundai, which has been making fuel cell vehicles
in low volumes since 2013. Ratcliffe may also use Hyundaiâ€™s fuel cell
system in the Grenadier, the Land Rover-like sport utility vehicle
Ineos plans to bring to market next year.

Makers of cars and chemicals are finding common ground in their
pursuit of hydrogen projects. Targets are being set globally to phase
out the combustion engine and decarbonize industrial
production. Ineos, which makes 300,000 tons of hydrogen annually,
could play an instrumental role in helping set up the infrastructure
Hyundai needs for models like the Nexo SUV to catch on in Europe"

It's still hilarious to me as an observation that our vacation
activities, "rest", "fun" today used to be simply regular life for the
longest span of our lives. Good

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
