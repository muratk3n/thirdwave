Super Mario calls ECB, he is like "a-bond a-selling a-can a-raise
a-rates, a-help us". ECB is like 'sure'.

---

I bet they do it to keep the bond rates low so indebted countries can
turn over debt.

---

Why is the ECB buying up bonds.. u r mucking up  the signal

It was probably due to the "changed strategy" where Mexico
[itself](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/trumps-deal-mexico-could-have-unintended-effects/592828/)
became a wall.

Dec 2020: "[ICE] arrested and deported fewer people last fiscal year
than in any other during President Donald Trump's term... a trend the
agency has linked to restrictions forced by the Covid-19 pandemic and
a changing strategy on the U.S.-Mexico border"

Khan is like boomer Trek, man.. and boomers are busy w other stuff,
checking returns of their real estate, so u gotta make some other
stuff. Little later ST material, or if you want to go "dark and edgy"
try Firefly approach, and stay away from cuck.

---

TBH never really cared for the Khan story of Trek.. Khan is based on a
Trek OS movie, which I watched many years ago, it was ok.. but sorta
old now. No significance for me, at the level of say, Borg.

Fossil based energy system was advantageout for US.. ample resources
that are easy to get to.. But.. the planet is getting screwed in the
process. Renewable fuels might give other nations little more
advantage, but fine, we take it from there, every1 competes on other fronts.

H2 energy density 39.7 kWh. Typical tanker carries 400,000 barrels, 1
barrel oil gives 1/2 barrel gasoline, barrel 0.158 m3, gasoline is
748.90002 kg/m3, has 12.88 kwh/kg energy density,


```python
print ('%0.2f kwh' % (2000*1000*39.7))
print ('%0.2f kwh' % (400000*0.5*0.158*748.9*12.88))
```

```text
79400000.00 kwh
304808291.20 kwh
```

Hey the tech will improve I am sure.. this isnt bad for first. Another
good news is the proposed C-H2 ship uses its own fuel to propel
itself; carrying zero emission fuel with zero emission! Sign me up!

Except for special ed and early students, there is absolutely no need
for a teacher to be present in the old sense of the word.. It is even
downright harmful that a random average jagoff is teaching kids
algebra, calculus.  US is all about efficiency, innovation, they need
to get the ball rolling.

---

I hope delivery of the lectures do not require a "live teacher". But
Google is all about scale, so probably not.

---

Yes, good. Do this instead of that quantum bullshit.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
