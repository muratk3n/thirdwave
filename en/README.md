Germany has a long history with synthetic fuels...  So they extracted
this thing, a gasoline-like fuel from coal, denser in energy no doubt
and easily transportable.

I remember reading fuel shortage was a major reason of DE losing the
war. But I seem to recall they could not produce enough of it. This
article says otherwise. The facilities were bombed.

"The leaders of World War II, on both sides, knew that an army's
lifeblood was petroleum. Ironically, before the War, experts had
scoffed at Adolph Hitler's idea that he could conquer the world
largely because Germany had almost no indigenous supplies of
petroleum. Hitler, however, had begun assembling a large industrial
complex to manufacture synthetic petroleum from Germany's abundant
coal supplies.

When Allied bombing of the German synfuels plants began taking its
toll in late 1944 and early 1945, the entire Nazi war machine began
grinding to a halt. More than 92 percent of Germany's aviation
gasoline and half its total petroleum during World War II had come
from synthetic fuel plants. At its peak in early 1944, the German
synfuels effort produced more than 124,000 barrels per day from 25
plants. In February 1945, one month after Allied forces turned back
the Hitler's troops at the Battle of the Bulge, German production of
synthetic aviation gasoline amounted to just a thousand tons"

What is free abt a trade when it is actively encouraged, mostly abt
slave labor, and the other side of a trade isnt honored (fin is open
to CH close to US)

---

This confirms my general view that libertard is a cosseted cuck. His
"free" society has to be constructed around him, so he can play house
in his little utopia. All that's required is things generally look /
sound free. Ish.

Lot of libertard goldcucks are pro-China arent they? Because, u know,
"free trade"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
