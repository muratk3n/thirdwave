Lesson here for all teachers, dont dumb stuff down for shinier
delivery. Your jobs is to *demystify*, not creating a new level of
mystery around your character, your props, or whatever.

Carl Sagan had an [eduvid](https://youtu.be/G8cbIWMv0rI?t=333) on that
too. Not bad, but lemme tell u what you did wrong here Carl, forgot to
mention how stick angle translates to btw-city angle..

He is really rockin that brown jacket with the turtleneck tho. Very
disco, Studio 54, I dig it, but some stuff got lost during the show..

Extend rays like below, implies angle between two cities is 7.2
relative to Earth center

Btw city angle is 7.2 out of 360 deg. He had a guy walk btw cities,
dist 5000 stadia = 800 km. Convert angle ratio to dist ratio,

```python
print ('%0.0f km' % (360/7.2 * 800))
```

```text
40000 km
```

This guy found a good approx for Earth circumference with f-ing
sticks, shadows, simple angle measurement. Ella re malaka

Library as in the freaking Library of Alexandria

First approx calculation of Earth circumference, BC 200s. Oh
yeah. Erotosthenes (scientists, head librarian) heard from someone,
during summer solst., stick in Syene has no shadow, at noon. He tried
it in Alexandria (little north) saw shadow. Measured angle, 7.2
degrees,

Politico: "The Rocky Road to Bidencare — Fresh off securing the first
major expansion of Obamacare since the law’s passage a decade ago,
Democrats are dipping their toes into the next major health care
fight...  The health care industry is already trying to kill it. A
lobbying group backed by the industry is running state and national
ads against the idea"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
