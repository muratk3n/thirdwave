This call was for 12:00 UTC. They really flipped the bird to
California with that one.

Saw a note for a conf call at with potentially participants from all
over the world.

What is the optimal global time for a global call I wonder... ðŸ¤” For
each optimal time the worst case is always the guy on the oppo side of
the globe, but that big swath of Pacific u can ignore, then 15:00
UTC+0 is good..? 10:00 AM for US East, 7:00 AM West, 12:00 PM Japan.

Tony Blair said a while back "[the EU] will never give a Brexiter
government a good deal". He is right. I dont think the dynamics around
that changed no matter how many marketing tricks UK employs or uses
its "Otto poodles", so called "Turks" to create annoyance.

DW host is right, talks were "frank" is diplomatic talk for "dust up".

It's a freak ideology, has zero chance of getting traction, unless
things are not going very bad (anything-goes environments). Pro biz
small gov is the best they can hope for ala the Tea Party.

"@EricLevitz

The intellectual vanguard of "pro-worker conservatism" at @AmerCompass
has a (relatively) coherent and politically promising vision for
reform â€” and little hope of getting the GOP to adopt it"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
