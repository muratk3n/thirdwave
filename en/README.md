Thailand.. I've been there once, and it has been in turmoil ever
since... ;)

I remember shooting the shit with ppl there, and in Singapore, about
Thaksin. Good times..

I'll never forget when we went to a movie theather in Bangkok and
right before the movie started, a gov program was displayed praising
the king, and **everyone** got up and put a hand on chest and said
some shit. Like 'Praise the king' or something like that.

Switzerland doesnt join anything. EU, NATO.. But they wouldn't join UN
either, for a long time? Get this, North Korea joined before them. The
only country who joined after did not exist before that time. Wassup!

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
