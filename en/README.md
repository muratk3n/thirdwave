Open Source Guru, Hintjens: "I’m writing this in late 2011. In March,
Microsoft paid Nokia about 1 billion dollars for a deal that gave
Microsoft access to Nokia’s patents. A little later, HTC bought S3 for
300 million dollars, to get access to S3’s patents, mainly because
Microsoft and Apple were attacking it. Then in July, a group of firms
(Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, RIM, Sony, EMC, Ericsson) paid 4.5 billion
dollars for a set of patents from Nortel. Google bid somewhat less,
and lost the auction. In October, Sony paid 1.45 billion dollars for
Ericsson’s patent portfolio. Then in November, Google got Motorola
Mobility, and its patents, for 12.5 billion dollars.

What’s staggering here is that in 2011, firms paid about 20 billion
dollars for patent rights. In 2010, Apple spent 1.8 billion dollars in
R&D. Google spent about 4 billion dollars. The total for the whole
software industry can’t be much more than that 20 billion dollars...

The patent wars for one segment of technology are costing as much as
R&D into the future of all software technology combined"

"The idea that people primarily drank beer throughout the Middle Ages
is widespread -- and also wrong. A number of records from medieval

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
