Lacking Sound Management"

We are not that used to the idea of China - Russia competition
lately. Most watchers argue about the "alliance" and degree of
cooperation of the two. Sure, there's a lot of cooperation. But,
competition between the two is growing across the board. Neither
Moscow, nor Beijing like to talk about this too much publicly. One
evident example is Central Asia where China has long surpassed Russia
in terms of investment and overall economic engagement. Russia still
holds to the security role but it is being challenged by China
continuously.

Another telling example is Serbia. Russia's "little sister" that is
becoming truly a battleground for Moscow and Beijing. China's trade
with Serbia is already surpassing Russia's, same goes for the
investment. China is challenging Russia as a main arms exporter.

And yet another story is Covid vaccine. We have a detailed text at
@RiddleRussia on this coming up later this week. China-Russia
competition is "almost silent" but nevertheless growing. And it
doesn't seem that Russia is winning"

"The episode examines 'mob mentality,' the court of public opinion,

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
