Good comparison w Dominican Republic (right next door). 

Acemoglu: "Why is Haiti so poor?.. Haitians shocked the world with a
formidable slave revolt in 1791, ultimately leading to independence
from France. But this revolt did not lead to the development of
inclusive institutions. To start with, the fight against the French,
who attempted to retake their prize colony several times, was
protracted and costly. Dubois, for example, argues that the fiscal
needs imposed by this continued war made the abolition of slavery
essentially impossible. It probably also stunted the subsequent
political development of this new independent state by excessively
militarizing its politics. But perhaps more important was the vicious
circle of extractive institutions"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
