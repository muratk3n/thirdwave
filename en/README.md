This is chemical warfare.. 

No wonder Russkies are so into Whataboutism.. There is ample material
for it.

"During the Vietnam War, the U.S military engaged in an aggressive
program of chemical warfare codenamed Operation Ranch Hand. From 1961
to 1971, the U.S. military sprayed a range of herbicides across more
than 4.5 million acres of Vietnam to destroy the forest cover and food
crops used by enemy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops...

In addition to the massive environmental devastation of the
U.S. defoliation program in Vietnam, that nation has reported that
some 400,000 people were killed or maimed as a result of exposure to
herbicides like Agent Orange"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
