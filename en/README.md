Hey if u missed the boat on the next consumer OS dominance, you can
always sue to get your cut.

"Every time you buy an Android smartphone or tablet, Microsoft is
likely receiving 5 to 15 dollars. They likely make at least $2 billion
per year from Android. This financial agreement is all about patent
royalties. Microsoft claims to hold software patents that Android
infringes on, and they threaten lawsuits against Android device
manufacturers until they settle"

Calling weather forecasting 'AI' denigrates the significant advances
made in weather forecasting over the past century.

On the other hand, I trust weather forecasting more than AI, so
perhaps it‚Äôs appropriate that the AI Institute for Trustworthy AI was
awarded to meteorologists at Oklahoma U"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
