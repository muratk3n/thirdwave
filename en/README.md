That Trump is talking about a pardon for Snowden, & @RepThomasMassie
is now explicitly calling for one, should not obscure that this is not
a right-wing view. Includes groups as disparate as ACLU, NYT Ed Page,
ex-Obama officials & Church Committee staffers"

Kelager: "The fluid is constrained to stay with the grid. It simply
cannot exist outside the grid domain, and thus makes it a difficult
problem to let the fluid flow naturally, e.g. when a fluid container
fractures"

---

Kelager: "The Navier-Stokes equations .. formulate the motion of an
Eulerian fluid"

---

.. and the Eulerian means that a person "likes to watch"? ðŸ˜¶

---

Lagrangian viewpoint -- does that make a person French minded?

---

SPH (for fluid simulation) uses the Lagrangian viewpoint. I guess this
viewpoint comes more natural to me bcz of software and simuation
background; thinking of particles that are followed / simulated make
more sense than "the Eularian viewpoint", thinking a predefined grid
that doens't change and u watch the fluid passing through. In either
case number of particles / grid size defines the precision of the
calculation, but IMO Lagrangian viewpoint can get better precision,
especially in edge cases.

Constructing societies that are against human nature (meaning forager)
can cause many ills. I bet that is one reason for the *hikikomori* in
Japan, the reclusive adolescents who dont leave home. This cld be a
way to subconciously reduce excessive stimuli which modern life
generates in excess, especially in cities. We are built for a certain
level of stimuli anything over that causes problems. In the West ppl
might not become recluse but cld act oddly in different ways, maybe
crime or other things.

Yes but the launch window is every 2 years. You dont go to Mars any
f-ing time you please, the most efficient time is during the
window. Why did all these recent launches cram into that one period? This is why.

Jira sucks

"@iLemming

Workforce churn/attrition rates in a given company are proportional to
the number of tickets in Jira. Software Developers stay longer in a
company that doesn't use Jira. This isn't even a theory, we all know
that"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
