SS is responsible for foreign policy, its intent, execution, and one
clear adminstrative work they do is running the embassies. And spies
usually assume a diplomat cover, and/or need the embassy as a
go-through point. Ergo, SS can allow / deny certain individuals, spies
perhaps in a country, influencing intelligence ops in that country,
effecting on-the-ground events. SecState matters.

"How can a SecState influence events on the ground? As in underhanded stuff"

It is concoction. Theather. Look; someone like Tucker Carlson, who
recently started to talk about some traditionally left issues (this is
how far, and low the Dems had fallen, their abandoned ideas were
picked up by others) is pretty big anti-abortion guy right? Well, but
his religion, Presbyterianism, is not strictly anti-abortion. In fact
none of them are! This guy is the only one - he jokes about it - the
rest of the joke goes, there is only one other Presb woman who is that
way, and he is married to her. Now forget one side "imploring", trying
to "convince", "one up" the other side. Imagine that hand that goes
out in the world, weeds out all likely candidates and picks the only
Presbyterian *in the world* who is anti-abortion.. You can't fight
this. The stage is set. With a certain line-up you will get a certain
theather. Pre-determined. Now TS exceeded his programming so to speak,
talks about some other stuff, and we love seeing Glenn Greenwald on
Fox. But there is a certain institutional setup in play here, which
can't be fought by more punditry from the "other side".

There is serious money to be made from it too.. So much of it in fact,
even Tubers downstreamhave been feasting on the left-overs for years!
Forget mainstream!

The game is agree on all primary issues, raise a ruckus on secondary
bullshit ones, on "4G" - Green, Gays, Guns, God.

Richard Fucking Nixon founded the EPA, but pfff, that's so
yesterday. Up until a few years not a single Republican would touch an
environmental issue with a ten-foot pole.

"But why do pundits jump up and down all the time?"

True. US has [faux polarization](2018/05/polarization.md). 

Caitlin Johnstone: "When you look at US politics, it appears as though
there are two mainstream political factions that very strongly
disagree with one another. 'Divided' is a word that comes up a
lot. 'Polarized' is another. It is of course true that a whole lot of
emotion flows between these two factions, and most of it is indeed
negative. The hot topics of any given news cycle in America will
typically involve more than one story pertaining to the vitriolic
enmity between them.  But beneath all the hurled insults and heated
debates, these two factions are actually furiously agreeing with one
another. Theyâ€™re agreeing the entire time"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
