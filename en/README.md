This is a vital pt that bears repeating: freedom costs less. There is
nothing good about the Chink system, the c*%ksuckers spend half their
money on internal security.

Why gender swap, race swap existing characters?

I wonder how people would react if we modified female, or black
characters. Lets say, I take Andy Dick, and make him White
Shaft. Would black people like that?  Imagine the scene, bar door
swings open, and this guy walks in with the shades on, has the leather
jacket.. the music playing wha wha-wha-wha wha wha Andy walking with
that strut. How would that go down? That would be insane right?

"If Penthouse suddenly switched all of its glossy double-page spreads
to abs and cocks, you‚Äôd expect some backlash. A few awkward
silences. Probably a sharp drop in subscriptions.

Does this make its readers a pack of bigots, misandrists, and
man-hating homophobes burdened by fragile sexuality? No. They were
simply looking for something else. The magazine‚Äôs target audience has
an established sexual preference, confirming the old adage ‚Äòsex
sells!‚Äô is as true for Penthouse as it is for a fifty-year-old science
fiction show.

Doctor Who is the James Bond of the geek world ‚Äì men want to be him,
and girls want to shag him. I can‚Äôt speak for the boys, but who
doesn‚Äôt want a gorgeous, older boyfriend with a time machine, infinite
bank balance, no job, endless adventure, and a demi-god status in the
universe? He is an inconvenient sexual fantasy that contradicts the
preferred social politics of the BBC, despite being its flagship show.

It is no accident that ratings soared when Scottish heart-throb David
Tennant took over the role in 2005 alongside his young, attractive
female companion Billie Piper. Their will-they, won‚Äôt-they romantic
tragedy elevated the BBC production out of the fringe geek world and
into the mainstream market of swooning teenagers.... 

2018 saw the progressive agenda inside the BBC hit peak woke ‚Äì
cannibalising their golden goose. The desire to promote inclusivity
with casting choices, led new showrunner Chris Chibnall to hire Jodie
Whittaker as the first female Doctor. Token casting is normally fatal
but identifying as a taxpayer parasite makes it impossible for the BBC
to ‚Äògo broke‚Äô like its corporate peers. This artificial survival
allowed us to watch the gender-bender experiment play out to hilarious
disparities between glowing critical reviews and god-awful audience
scores that were so bad BBC management kept deleting them"

Beckley: "The U.S. military ... can sink Chinese ships and submarines
virtually anywhere in East Asia. The main reason is that the United
States has dozens of missile-armed submarines that are almost
invulnerable to China‚Äôs notoriously weak antisubmarine
capabilities. In wartime, U.S. submarines, with the aid of America‚Äôs
vast undersea surveillance network in East Asia, could set up picket
lines near the combat theater, or near China‚Äôs ports, and sink China‚Äôs
ships and submarines with torpedoes, missiles, and mines"

Beckley: "Taiwan retains enduring advantages that could make the island
virtually unconquerable‚Äîprovided that Taipei and Washington capitalize
on them. Armadas of the kind China would need to invade or blockade
Taiwan are extremely vulnerable to modern missiles and
mines. Meanwhile, the Taiwan Strait is perilous‚Äîtyphoons and 20-foot
waves are common most of the year‚Äîand Taiwan itself is a natural
fortress. Its east coast consists of steep cliffs, and its west coast
is dominated by mud flats that extend miles out to sea and are
buffeted by severe tides. As a result, there are only a dozen beaches
on Taiwan where an invading force could even land.

Taiwan‚Äôs defenders also have history on their side. No blockade in the
past 200 years has coerced a country into surrendering its
sovereignty, and there has been only one successful amphibious
invasion of a developed nation in modern history (the Allied invasion
of Italy in 1943). All other successful amphibious assaults were
against overstretched forces defending hastily dug positions on
foreign or contested territory with small arms. If China invaded
Taiwan today, it would be attacking massed forces defending fortified
positions on home soil with precision-guided munitions"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
