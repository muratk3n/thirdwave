Obviously previous dereg didnt help either, it created a freer
environment where new tech entropy / disruption could reach faster.

AG is no cookie; he knew industry, banks... 'The loan officer at a
bank knows more about their credit risk than anyone FED could employ'
he'd say having worked at these places... And yet that risk assesment
somehow failed. How? It always bothered me AG kept saying he never saw
it coming. Now I have a feeling why, he knew the industry through the
prism of old tech; A calling B, writing shit down, people shouting at
the market floor, B calling A back, etc.. and *some*
computerization. Nothing at the levels we see today.

This all sounds like a bizarre concoction of new tech and old; 2W
institutions, with 3W tech on top... You can't mix fast and slow this
way..

3W is not at a point it can build, right now it merely disrupts and
destroys. Like my earlier ex of Newt in front of a chat app, the app
disrupts the singular Speaker, adds nothing.

Greenspan, on 2008: "Another important source of the failure of risk
management was the almost indecipherable complexity of the broad
spectrum of new financial products and markets that developed as
number-crunching and communication capabilities soared.

Investment managers subcontracted an inordinately large part of their
task to the “safe harbor” risk designations of the credit-rating
agencies ...

Most investment officers believed no further judgment was required of
them because they were effectively held harmless by the judgments of
these government-sanctioned rating organizations. Especially
problematic were the triple-A ratings bestowed by the credit-rating
agencies on many securities that in fact proved highly toxic. Despite
decades of experience, the analysts at the credit-rating agencies
proved no more adept at anticipating the onset of crisis than the
investment community at large, and their favorable ratings of many
securities offered a false sense of security to a great many
investors....

Even with the breakdown of our sophisticated risk management models
and the failures of the credit-rating agencies, the financial system
would likely have held together had the third bulwark against
crisis—our regulatory system—functioned effectively. But it, too,
failed for many of the same reasons that risk management and the
credit-rating agencies failed: an underappreciation of the risks faced
by the financial system and an increasing complexity that made
effective oversight especially difficult."

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
