Jacobin: "Big Pharma Is Fighting to Deny Canadians Access to
Treatment... The vast majority of Canadians want a national pharmacare

battling to obstruct it"

No expansion of the universe, light *appears* redshifted.

His cast of characters are solid. Einstein (at least his 1911 ideas
which he allegedly mistakenly abandoned), Dicke, the great Dirac

---

More Unzic ideas; Robert Dicke rediscovered relativity with
corrections (1957), speed of light should not be constant. 

---

From *55 megaparsecs* away from Earth, a thing theoretically pulls
everything to itself, including light, HTF can it be "seen"?

---

Yes, singularities in math "predict' black holes. But accrd to WK
field equations should not contain singularities to begin with (curr
math is faulty). Whereever we take measurements, there is always a
number, we never come across a "singularity measurement".

---

Obviously there was some good work around data collecting,
analysis. Talking abt the underlying domain here

---

There was so much SJW biz surrounding the whole thing too... Whenever
there is SJW buzz, cld it be a sign the field, the domain is dying?
Bcz most r focused about taking up existing positions inside, on set
"hierarchies" than breaking new ground? Maybe.

Not a good counterarg. If I am on GMail I can still send email to
someone on Yahoo Mail, through SMTP protocol. Twitter, Facebook,
Whatsapp are all self-contained platforms.

"So what if social networks were based on protocols, there is GMail,
with over a billion users"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
