It's nearly midnight and I can't dim my lights because a server on the
other side of the world is acting up"

Reuters: "Toyota unveils new fuel cell car in fresh push on hydrogen technology"

---

Noted W was mentioned; big deal coming from a former oilman.

"Green hydrogen, an alternative fuel generated with clean energy, is
experiencing a global resurgence and has been identified as the clean
energy source that could help bring the world to net-zero emissions in
the coming decades.

It was initially touted in the U.S. during President George W. Bush's
first term, when it was nicknamed the "freedom fuel."

Now, President-elect Joe Biden is promising that the U.S. will be able
to access green hydrogen at the same cost as conventional hydrogen
within a decade as part of his clean energy plan. Several countries
around the world already invest heavily into it, including Chile,
Japan, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Australia"

Working with hair-splitting detail as programmer, is much more intense
than, say, in social sciences bcz at the end of the day programmatic
concepts, however abstract at first, need to *compile*, i.e. accepted
by a software compiler to be turned into machine code. So programmers
in some ways have compilers in their heads, that does strict
checks. Obviously every spoken language has also syntactic rules, but
none that can be verified instantly, to its tiniest comma, and can be
executed on-demand. So we run the compiler in our heads before
submitting code to the machine, we want to see as little errors as
possible, which makes it a stringent task. Do it a long time, you
really want to see that rapping dog at the end of the day. .

There were a lot of surprises in 2020, but I'd put the vastly reduced
salience of immigration in this election v. '18 and '20 on the
list. Immigration wasn't even mentioned in the first debate, and the
exit poll didn't bother to ask about it, either"

Yea I saw daily intake req for 1000 mg which is crazy. Youd have to
sit and eat yogurt, eggs all day.

"Do we really need all that calcium? ... The tide started to turn in
2005 when results from two British studies showed that calcium didn't
prevent fractures ‚Äî even when taken in combination with vitamin
D. [another research] showed that postmenopausal women who took a
calcium‚Äìvitamin D combination were no less likely to break their hip
than women who took a placebo pill"

I watched 'nother docu on nuclear (fission) and fusion. Fusion sounds
far off, and I am not convinced on fission's waste handling, and
safety.

Solar power is plenty, with incr panel efficiency (right now at 25%)
itll be better. Also there is non-fracking fossil + CCS (at the
source).

Not all. Let's see... some net zero commitmemts are Sweden for 2045,
and United Kingdom, France, Denmark, New Zealand, Hungary for 2050.

Yes, Sweden, 39% is ‚ò¢Ô∏è, France's 71% of electricity comes from ‚ò¢Ô∏è. But
UK or Denmark dont have much of it.

"Most countries who commited to net-zero get their energy from
nuclear"

At the end of the day, by and large, Feynman did science to compute
stuff. He liked doing that, and I believe this is the right attitude
to have, in general, even for ppl who are deep in the weeds of
theory. The attitude also jels well with the beginning of modern
science, Newton was an active computer.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
