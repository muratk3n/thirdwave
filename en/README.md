I remember that pencil-neck motherlover, Mogg, using this "regulation
arbitrage" argument for Brexit... Seriously.. Moron actually thought
EU would just sit on their ass and do nothing? How effin dumb are

This "matching regulation" biz reveals all you need to know about
Brexit; it's like Brexiters want EU do whatever they're told.. If UK
reduces regulation, EU says 'we can raise tariffs to balance that'. UK
wld look more attractive in that env (seemingly at least, at first)
and EU says 'we dont want to lose business to arbitrage', after
breakup UK not being part of that "we". UK says now 'you shouldn't do
that'. Well after Brexit you are "free", and so are they... Why
shouldn't they do what's good for them? They must follow your
directives?

cuntness in them.. Stiff upper lip Eton sockcuckers. Albeit with less
stiff upper lip, more relaxed demeanor, but still reeegal.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
