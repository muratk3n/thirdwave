WRONG. There is always, at least one other alternative.

"ZeroAvia has made headlines in its native California and the UK by
test flying a six-seat Piper M350 converted to run on tanked gaseous
hydrogen feeding a fuel cell which drives an electric motor.

Miftakhov describes ZeroAvia as a powertrain company and is bullish
about the programme. Hydrogen fuel, he believes, can achieve not only
zero emissions but also be cost-competitive with kerosene for small
aircraft as soon as 2023, when he hopes to have his system in service
on a 10- to 20-seater; talks are underway with operators of aircraft
like the Beechcraft King Air, Cessna Caravan or Viking Air Twin Otter"

If H2 conversion is at the source, it is okay, unless natgas is
obtained through fracking.

Green H2 is still preferable obv.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
