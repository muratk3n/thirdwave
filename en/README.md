Vague, *A Brief History of Doom*: "The iconic structures of American
skylines form the silhouette of the Great Depression: New Yorkâ€™s
Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, and RCA Building; Chicagoâ€™s
Merchandise Mart, Wrigley Building, and Tribune Tower; Philadelphiaâ€™s
PSFS Building; Los Angelesâ€™s City Hall; Dallasâ€™s Cotton Exchange
Building; Detroitâ€™s Fischer Building; and Houstonâ€™s Gulf
Building. These are enduring architectural feats of the 1920s,
vestiges of the real estate eruption that came before the fall. Many
were speculative projects, unsupported by actual real estate demand;
begun toward the end of the 1920s, when loans were still available;
and finished after the crash, when lenders had little choice but to
make funds available to complete construction or else see their entire
loan go bad. None was financially successful for its original
investors. They remained partly or largely empty for a decade or more
after completion, as would hundreds of others"

The AG is black BTW. Craft is female. Isnt Mitch also married to a
Asian? An eq opportunity kinda guy.

"Mitch McConnell has compiled a short list of successors in his home
state of Kentucky, preparing for the possibility that he does not
serve out his full term...  The list is topped by his protÃ©gÃ©, state
Attorney General Daniel Cameron, and also includes former United
Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft"

"Australia-based hydrogen specialist Enegix Energy is planning to
build a green hydrogen plant onÂ 500 hectares of commercial land in the
Port of PecÃ©m, in the Brazilian, northeastern state of CearÃ¡. The
facility is expected to be located in the state of CearÃ¡ and to be
powered by around 3.6 GW of wind and solar facilities located in the
region"

*The Time Machine*, 2002 is about taking a stand IMO. The prof loses
his wife, tries to save her by going to past, fails. Then he "escapes
to the future", keeps going further and further in time, and during
stops he sees one catastrophe after another. One way to see that
future was bad bcz prof wasnt in their history. See? The library
assist prog did not know abt time travel tech waay ahead, so his
science had not been reinvented after him. Of course this is unlikely
the non-fictional world, techniques are discovered simultaneously by
many. But allowing this 1 artistic license, this cld be the
message. And only after prof starts fighting for **a** present (the
idyllic place) things start to improve. Could not save his wife, but
could help some, a certain time period.

UBI + Crypto is likely 3W. Current 2W system cld do UBI, through its channels, but
seems unlikely for now.

---

UBI mechanism? Easy. 1st of every month the system does a "printing
round", expands its base by depositing $ digitally into everyone's
acct. And genuine person detection wld be needed too, yes.

---

A new cyrpto is needed with UBI built-in.  Two birds with one stone;
monetary base expansion is achieved through UBI, stopping deflation,
in the meantime, helping create a mechanism of redistribution. Current
approaches are too stuck in "digital gold" mentality. They understand
computer science, but not economics.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
