Jacobin: "Finland Had a Patent-Free COVID-19 Vaccine Nine Months Ago —
But Still Went With Big Pharma. A team of leading Finnish researchers
had a patent-free COVID-19 vaccine ready last May, which could have
allowed countries all over the world to inoculate their populations
without paying top dollar. Yet rather than help the initiative,
Finland's government sided with Big Pharma — showing how a
patent-based funding model puts profit over public health"

Gravity is the [main issue](2020/09/space-exploration-goals-colonization.md).
Must have a near-Earth gravity.

"Why not go to any ol' place in space and colonize?"

Started using an alternate browser on YouTube, wout logging to GOOG,
works just fine. Recommendations, to the extent they worked before,
continue to work, YT keeps track prev watched vids using browser
cookie, wout knowing true ID. If I manually remove the cookie, the
memory is gone, clean slate.

Report was prepared by H2 Council and McKinsey.

The council is made up of >100 companies, w some [well-known](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvS25tLXYAAnWCA?format=jpg&name=small)
names.

"Longer-term, a hydrogen pipeline network offers the most
cost-efficient means of distribution. For example, pipelines can
transmit 10 times the energy at one-eighth the costs associated with
electricity transmission lines and have capex costs similar to those
for natural gas. The industry can partially reuse existing gas
infrastructure, but even newly constructed pipelines would not be cost
prohibitive (assuming leakage and other safety risks are properly
addressed). For example, we estimate the cost to transport hydrogen
from North Africa to central Germany via pipeline could amount to
about USD 0.5 per kg of H2 – less than the cost difference of domestic
renewable hydrogen production in these two regions"

Air can be DIY compressed in plastic soda bottles, or any other
regular item.

Just saw this kid, pumps 45 psi into PVC pipe through car tire valve
and a hand pump, sealed one end with ball valve, once released the
thing shot a nail with such power it went in the whole 3 inches into
plywood... Dont try at home, jaw-jaw not war-war, etc but this stuff
is no joke... Gases, liquids can be extremely efficient.

Gases, liquids are awesome.

But there cld be true randomness present.. from outside actors, as in
players in a big simulation, whose choices r independent of any
self-contained stimuli.

---

A lot of random appearing stuff may not be random.. Chaos is similar,
but in multiple dimensions, like weather. Its unpredictability stems
tiny deviations causing large changes later, and we can never measure
the tiny starting point effectively, even if we had the perfect
formula describing everything.

Creating randomness deterministicallly, sure. Pseudorandom numbers are
generated with algorithms, with the right code u can generate billions
of numbers, before the sequence repeats itself.

H2->engine could even be more efficient than H2->electricity->engine. 

"Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engine & Turbocharger, Ltd (MHIET)
is conducting tests on a pure hydrogen gas engine based on its
four-stroke diesel and gas engine technology"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
