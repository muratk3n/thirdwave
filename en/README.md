With -32% GDP growth Trump is toast. His only chance is if people
"understand" the predicament (not in the model, never seen before
situation), and if that offsets growth as if it was zero percent, as
in none, then the situation becomes neck and neck due to
incumbency. Long shot. Net popularity at -9%.

havlamadan önce, geçmişteki hatalarının muhasebesini yapmanı tavsiye
ederim.

A thought: Making the oligarchic ruling class more diverse should be a
lower priority than ending the existence of an oligarchic ruling
class.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
