Words like "summation" are misleading.. We are computing a "smart
sum", a sum that takes into account the upper boundary. Or a [smart
multiplication](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-calculus-analogy-integrals-as-multiplication/).

---

How about the top part? They are not the same. Their upper boundary
changes as we go to right, depending on the function we are
integrating, so it's not simple sum.

Pay attn that integration result too, anything above first degree will
give you polynomial of deg higher and including than 2 = nonlinearity.

"If we think of integration of regular functions, they look like
addition of simple components, side by side, wout flipping"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
