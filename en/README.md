Calc on past 40 years below. See a -0.89 correlation between gold and
treasuries.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
today = datetime.datetime.now()
start=datetime.datetime(1980, 1, 1)
end=datetime.datetime(today.year, today.month, today.day)
df = web.DataReader(['GC=F', '^TNX','DX-Y.NYB'], 'yahoo', start, end)['Adj Close']
df.columns = ['gold','treasuries','dollar']
df = df.dropna()
print (df.tail(4))
```

The highest correlation among the triplet dollar, gold, and treasuries
is between treasuries and gold. This corr is **highly** negative. The
correlation between dollar and gold is much weaker. This means growth
(and inflation) expectations are the main drivers, not some
end-of-the-world currency collapse scenario.

"But printing money will crush the dollar, that's what I know!"

Just look at FED [GPDNow](https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) estimate..
As of 3/1 the estimate is 10%.

I am sure they use many base indicators to calculate this.. there are
some known ones, eg [ISM PMI](2019/05/stats.md#gdpism) That's how I knew
a month ago growth was coming.

"How can some people know GDP will grow?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
