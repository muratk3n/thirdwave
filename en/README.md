BTW Morales, who did some good things in his country, also f--d up in
a way.. he went to referandum for term extension, lost, had their SC
to overturn it, then won the general election. Turns out there was no
fraud in either, but at that point there was a general "funkyness" in
the air, and ppl could make that case... The left needs to be careful
with this stuff. He should have stepped down, give the reins to the
next guy. And guess what, after bunch of unnecessary drama that is
exactly what happened.

A lot of humor shared here is the type where tech types decompress
with; after paying attn to hair splitting detail for an extended
period of time, something like a rapping [dog](https://youtu.be/0ZUHqH4rDTg?t=17)
becomes hilarious.

*Riddick* 2013, such gutsy movie. Who would bet an entire movie on an
opening sequence with a guy trying to survive on a desolate planet?
Its basically this guy and his dog, at first.. that's it. Fantastic.

Rapaport: "[B]oth solids and gases have well-developed theoretical
foundations, but there is no general theory of liquids. For solids,
theory begins by assuming that the atomic constituents undergo small
oscillations about fixed lattice positions; for gases, independent
atoms are assumed and interactions are introduced as weak
perturbations. In the case of liquids, however, the interactions are
as important as in the solid state, but there is no underlying ordered
structure to begin with"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
