Main news sources currently, *DW* and *France 24 English*, for TV
like, in the background, news talking head type of watching. Less
drama, calmer, and once in a while a good documentary (on DW)

Haha a German on DW just used the word *schadenfreude* for DJT.

Just playin man.. Dont die on your ppl Trump

Of course Pence is all about thoughts and prayers... as in he is
praying for Trump *to die*.

Glad to be of help to the US weapons industry.

Just in: the State Department has approved a potential $417 million
sale to Egypt of a Maritime Domain Awareness system, including fixed
and mobile radar units to monitor and defend the country's "maritime
boundary, natural resources, and ports."

I guess that's changed a little bit.. I have to update my act

Me and Maria got a condo

I like how Kal-eee-fornia calls green vehicles "zero-emission vehicles",
not electric. That wld be fine for me too, technically, a fuel-cell
also generates electricity, but this wording helps to avoid confusion
and widens the definition.

And no, there are no parallels here to the EU / UK relation ðŸ¤¨ ðŸ™„

Everyone who is pro these empires, whether it is Rome, Byzantium or
"Otto" have an agenda.

"Like all humanities [archeology] is a product of its time and
Victorian archaeologists were part of a British Empire which compared
itself to Rome, so they had every reason to suggest that when great
empires collapse disaster and chaos follow"

---

There was no barbarism after Romans left Britain. The so-called Dark
Ages are a myth. What a shock.

Azerbaijani gobble gobble speaka sounds somewhat different than
Anatolian version. Same words mostly, but different expressions,
idioms.. ex, apparently they call the football goaly *kapÄ±cÄ±*, "the
doorman". Kinda funny.. And the air travel announcements; their pilots
announce plane landing with the words *the plain will now fall*. Story
goes once when it was announced my tiggers lost their shit.

You are slipping  Focker. Don't stay in that circle of trust ðŸ‘Œ

"If all goes according to plan, Plug Power will also move beyond the
humble fuel cell forklift for which it is known, and take to the
skies"

"@ZaidJilani

The most consistent thing about media, political media especially, is
it seems to thrive on fear. My whole life it's jumped from one panic
about exaggerated threat to another. It's not left or right, just
panic"

:) So I guess she is not a supporter anymore.. when did she fall off
the wagon? Or off the train.. or whatever it's called.. the circle of
trust ðŸ‘Œ ?

"@AnnCoulter

I don't think the conservative take on @realDonaldTrump paying no
taxes should be: BECAUSE HE'S SMART! I've paid nearly 50% of my income
in taxes, year after year, and any system that allows billionaires to
pay ZERO is unspeakable corrupt. How about changing it, Democrats?"

The Jeremy Rifkin 2002 book is key. It came out in the hell years of
post 2001 and made the first attempt of imagening a post oil future
(bcz it, rightfully, blamed oil addiction for the mishap). Even Dubya
was repeating lines from this book at the time. Sadly post oil turned
into "post ME oil (blaming ME addiction, reaching the conclusion if we
use our own we'll be fine)", US fossil resources were deployed and
another chance on green energy revolution was lost. Of course then
came 'the battery' and its the wild eyed retarded cult followers with
their 'hip certainty' and not enough brains to back it up. Fail
continued.

"@econjared

Note the incessant R whining about unemployed people getting gov't
support yet not a peep about their leader paying nothing in
taxes. It's capitalism for the unemployed; socialism for the rich"

It is the swing version of a Joey Bongiovi song... U know the one from
New Jersey... Good song too BTW

"The It's My Life jazz song sounded like another song, which was it?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
