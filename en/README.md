Business Insider: "'Unions lose in 90% of the cases when management

Too bad the Amazon unionization effort failed.. But 'ppl have spoken'
is the wrong conclusion to draw here.. The system was favoring the
employer. Change of labor laws needed? AMZN clearly was the better
closer.

Code

Flip the actors u can see the build-up (code 154) both ways.

Code 154 is "mobilization or increase of armed forces"

```python
import pandas as pd, zipfile
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth',-1)

dates = ['0331','0401'] # add more dates here w files

for dt in dates:
    with zipfile.ZipFile('gdelt/2021%s.export.CSV.zip' % dt, 'r') as z:
         df = pd.read_csv(z.open('2021%s.export.CSV' % dt),sep='\t',header=None)
    print (len(df.columns))
    urls = df[57]
    cols = ['GlobalEventID', 'Day', 'MonthYear', 'Year', 'FractionDate',\
           'Actor1Code', 'Actor1Name', 'Actor1CountryCode', 'Actor1KnownGroupCode',\
           'Actor1EthnicCode', 'Actor1Religion1Code', 'Actor1Religion2Code',\
           'Actor1Type1Code', 'Actor1Type2Code', 'Actor1Type3Code', \
           'Actor2Code', 'Actor2Name', 'Actor2CountryCode', 'Actor2KnownGroupCode',
           'Actor2EthnicCode', 'Actor2Religion1Code', 'Actor2Religion2Code',
           'Actor2Type1Code', 'Actor2Type2Code', 'Actor2Type3Code', \
           'IsRootEvent','EventCode', 'EventBaseCode']
    df2 = df[range(len(cols))]
    df2.columns = cols

    flt = (df2.EventCode==154) & (df2.Actor1Code=='RUS') & (df2.Actor2Code=='UKR')
    print (dt)
    df3 = df2[flt]
    if not df3.empty:
        print (df3[['Actor1Code','Actor2Code','EventCode','EventBaseCode']])
        url3 = urls[flt]
        print (url3)
```

I looked at GDELT [event files](http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/),
going back go March 1st; did not find any initial Ukraine
movement. The first time any build-up is reported in the region, in
the 1/3-1/4 timeframe, was April 1, by RUS. One of the news links
parsed by GDELT is [here](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/top-us-general-calls-russia-ukraine-amid-reported-moscow-troop-buildup/).

"In terms of the latest escalation, who is responsible? Who deployed
its military first?  Russia or Ukraine?"

Maybe the mechanical vs wild animal theme in scifi movies is a
throwback to that feeling, way of coping with insane recent
advances. It was mysterious to be scared of the beast? Now smaller
ones are causing more damage.

Largest whale in length, 30 meters. Aircraft carrier, over 300 meters
in length.  The masses dont even compare. Whale has no chance. Its
funny from a time where humans were afraid of monsters at sea, now we
have monsters of our own.

"Could a whale damage a ship? Like an aircraft carrier?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
