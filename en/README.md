PA never spent $108 million of 175 million in CARES Act funding meant
for rent and mortgage relief. The money will now go to the Dept of
Corrections instead.

People who grow up in a place, from a very young age, get its culture
codes automagically by osmosis (embedded in the second-level emotional
brain), so they are citizens, no matter their ethnic, cultural
origin. Origin, assumed subculture matters little.

People might try to posture, "represent" around origin, perhaps as a
reaction to being called a certain label all their lives, but both
sides of that argument is wrong. 2 wrongs dont make 1 right.

Hidalgo's analysis teases out the presence of these networks through
'product palette complexity' in the data, which highly correlate with
GDP (higher than ed level). The better your network, more complex your
products, the higher your GDP.

Why does success story belong to host country for even late
immigrating scientists? Power of expertise networks. Working side by
side is an effective knowledge xfer channel, that's why inno likes
such pockets ... See [Hidalgo](2017/08/production-gdp-globalization.md).
U go to expt network, u benefit from it, innovate flows from it. Those
pockets, its country, get the credit.

I for one will be happy this aspect of the shitshow to be over, WH
being visibly divided on key issues. It always smacked off
incompetence, talking abt the head now, tactical moves of a flailing
inexperienced STP.

The docu made it sound Afghanistan was a nuisance, a problem Gorbachev
was sort stuck with.. But actually Gorbacev was adamantly against that
war, from the beginning. 

"The [Soviet] war in Afghanistan was a thorn in Gorbaceb's side [after he came to power]"

This dev board is fantastic. I am looking looking at an insanely

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
