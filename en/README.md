BTC specifically is badly designed but the next crypto cld remedy
that, fix the warts.

---

Maybe 1 cld see a crypto as holding a ticket that gets u into a
payment system, and the system is the value.. It is sorta circular
tho.. why would someone want to pay with a crypto? Bcz there are
others on it.. U get on it, then more might choose it for payments..

Ha :) NR never runs out of ways of hitting this thing, BTC.

The solution is more / better speech. Meddling with section 230 wld
hamper it IMO.

It's like arguing for the price of oil is high or low disregarding the
entire security apparatus to bring it into the market.

Water is more abundant and easy to process, jagoff. Even if water was
tad more harder to find, process, one is still needed more than the
other. Effin fin guy.. Sees only what he is allowed to "bet" on, that
is his world... 

Finance guy: "They say water is in nature and it's free. Diamonds also occur in
nature but they are not free"

The worst *Mission Impossible* is the second..? Nah man... it is
definitely the third. The Jar Jar one... It is objectively bad.

I have zero interest in approaches that cannot be scaled up. Works on
little toy examples in 2D not 3D? Pass.

Sounds like a culture code in play here. French cultural tug of war
is between freedom and privelege. See [Rapaille](2014/06/the-culture-code.md#france).

Unions [lost a lot of power](2019/08/focus-group-democracy.md) after
70s. The left sufered due to losing org structure and
leadership. Politicians themselves like that single contact to be
lobbied by, u cant have bunch of ppl running around trying to make
policy. Some kind of filter was needed

BTW the so-called Turkish coffee is actually Greek coffee, and that
itself is similar to a espresso, clearly all originating from
Aegy/Medi region; bunch of punks from distant whereever did not bring
it with them... Off-the-boat, or off-the-goat types like everyone else
who arrived and assimilated, picked these things up from their region.

Haha.. few Byzantian music samples below.. sounds awfullly like the

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
