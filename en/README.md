Whichever tech is used to generate energy doesn't matter, produce
renewable fuel, ship. H2 economy can handle all types of input.

There is [a plant](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2129691/chile-opens-vast-thermosolar-power-plant) in Chile,
they do some ultraviolet trickery, 700 hectares, 210 megawatts,

```python
hectare = 1000 # m2
"%0.2f percent efficiency" % (((110*1000*1000 / (700*hectare)) / sun_on_earth) * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '15.71 percent efficiency'
```

Ok.. not bad.. still not better than panels though.

---

Solar panels are at 20%. They are stuck there, but comparatively
speaking CSP is much lower than panels.

---

```python
acre = 4046.86 # m2
sun_on_earth = 1000 # W/m2
"%0.2f percent efficiency" % (((1*1000*1000 / (5*acre)) / sun_on_earth) * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '4.94 percent efficiency'
```

Not good

"While land needs will vary by technology, a typical CSP plant requires
5 to 10 acres of land per MW of capacity"

---

Sunlight Refineries... CSP.. They focus sunlight into one spot through mirrors,
generate heat.

What is the efficiency of the system I wonder

M98 galaxy is far away but blue shifted (coming close to us). Arent at
least all far away galaxies are supposed to get *away* from us?
Because of, you know, like the Big Bang and the expanding universe? ðŸ˜¶

Salt's antibacterial abilities are overlooked.. For preserving meat
dont we add salt (as well as drying)? Salt is added not bcz it tastes
good (nat selection might have introduced that later on), we add salt
because bacteria doesn't like salt. I argue same applies for skin
care; after a good swim in the sea, don't we feel better? The skin
feels better.. The Dead Sea is the world's saltiest body of water, and
it's known to have curative effects.. There is no magic here; just
plain ol' salt.

Tug-of-war around the net-zero decision in AU? Gov coalition partner
had a leadership change. Net0 was the culprit?

"Climate change sceptic Barnaby Joyce, who was deputy prime minister
from 2016 to 2018 but resigned after an extramarital affair with a
former staffer, won a [gov coalition partner] National party
leadership vote on Monday defeating incumbent Michael McCormack...

Joyce, who will be sworn in as deputy prime minister on Tuesday, said
his party will only support an energy policy that bolsters the
government's appeal in regional Australia - which is heavily dependent
on fossil fuel mining"

The Atlantic: "Wanting to copy the happiest people in the world is an
understandable impulse, but it distracts from a key message of the
happiness rankingsâ€”that equitable, balanced societies make for happier
residents...

People are more satisfied with their lives when they have a
comfortable standard of living, a supportive social network, good
health, the latitude to choose their course in life, and a government
they trust. The highest echelon of happy countries also tends to have
universal health care, ample paid vacation time, and affordable child
care"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
