Joe Kennedy‚Äôs camp is brushing off the Globe endorsement of Ed Markey
as 'something we fully anticipated' & an example of the establishment
protecting the status quo for the paper's 'disproportionately white,
well-off, well-educated readers.'"

@EFF

Earlier this month, Mexico passed a catastrophic new \#copyright law,
virtually overnight, without adequate consultation or debate. They did
it as part of Donald Trump's \#USMCA treaty.

Hah! Max Tegmark says exactly this, "Popper didn't say the totality of
any theory, but it should lead to stuff that you can test".

I see Keating shaking his head, like he heard something
earth-shattering.

That CERN guy too.

R u *kidding* me man..? u needed someone to say this?

Theorists should be able to find something testable. Giving up this is
insane.

This guy has to be a Stringer. Nobody is this dumb and desparate

\#ToE

Guy is questioning Popper bcz whatever theory he is peddling cannot
produce anything testable I bet.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
