They've been seeking for this f-ing thing for decades now.. and still
haven't found it?

Time to give up dude? Or no.. Just fudge another constant and move
on..?

The CERN presentation has a great title: "Desperately Seeking SUSY" ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£

[shakes head in disbelief]

Unzicker: "The reason why the standard model cannot calculate mass is
stunningly simple. Whatever formula may calculate the mass of a

particle, it has to have the physical unit of a mass, which is
kilograms, and those kilograms have to come out of the formula, you
can't pull it out of your ass. The only way to do it is to find
combinations of the fundamental constants of Nature, otherwise you are
cheating. But there is no such combination, as every high school kid
can understand... There is just one caveat - you can't do it unless
you use the gravitational constant G, that is, you consider gravity in
your model. But particle physicists donâ€™t do it because gravity is a
difficult business that goes above their minds. Itâ€™s outright lunatic
that they declare that calculating masses, alas, is impossible in the
standard model and at the same time deliberately disregard gravity
which would offer the only possibility to try it"

"[Wilczek] has by now lost multiple bets that the LHC would see SUSY
particles, including ones with Garrett Lisi in 2009 and Tord EkelÃ¶f in
2012. At this point, even diehards like Wilczek acknowledge that
chances that the LHC will see SUSY are slim. Another problem is that
increasingly sensitive proton decay experiments have also ruled out a
large part of the proton lifetimes predicted by the SUSY models
Wilczek favors"

Boeing did not only mess up on the control system of the MAX. They
messed up in the core aerodynamics first, they created a poorly
balanced plane, which they tried to fix using software. They made it
much easier for the control system to fail, basically.

People are awed and amazed at the electronics of these systems, but
let's not forget, during WW1 and and 2, planes could still fly without
any of these. Basic, solid aerodynamics made that possible. Now bunch
of office monkeys too used to their gadgetry and unrealistic computer
games think they can turn everything upside down, and "software" wld
take care of it. This is delusional / wishful thinking. This is the
mentality that gave you stagnant physics of decades, BEVs, IoT, errant
liberalism and lukewarm, ineffective politics with tech sparkle.

"'[R]ight now itâ€™s starting to look like [HFCs] are in the lead
[compared to battery electric-powered vehicles], and many experts
think that will continue,' said Matt Waller, the dean of the Sam
M. Walton College .. Waller said [they] could be better for the
environment than electric batteries because there isnâ€™t any poisonous
material to dispose of with hydrogen, and the only byproduct is water"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
