"Although they are increasing in popularity with consumers, electric
vehicles still account for a relatively small share of ground
transportation. Electrification is unlikely to replace conventional
jet fuel for air travel anytime soon.

That has some officials [in Hawaii] looking at another carbon-free

200 bar cylinders are standard, 40 liter will cost around $40
(recyclable anyway). Hyundai Nexo stores at 700 bars (10K psi), 3
tanks w enough H2 gas energy to move a car for >700 km.

Ah. `scipy` has a `constants` package.. No need to be "online" to
lookup basic unit conversions.

```python
import scipy.constants
print ('%0.2f' % scipy.constants.psi)
print ('%0.2f' % scipy.constants.bar)
print ('%0.2f' % (scipy.constants.psi*10000/scipy.constants.bar))
```

"Uber and Lyft say theyâ€™re just tech platforms, not transportation
companies that employ drivers, even as they tell city officials that
their driversâ€™ names should be treated as confidential trade secrets

"Both *Ghostbusters* and its sequel were a perfect encapsulation of
Ronald Reaganâ€™s 1980s, and the two movies reflect the ambivalent and
inchoate resentments of a rapidly deindustrializing working class. But
the most important â€” and culturally significant â€” embodiment of the
'Me First' decade in Ghostbusters was a small, pudgy green ghost who
eventually became known as 'Slimer.' ...

Instead of Slimer, Afterlifeâ€™s creators have given us Muncher, a
blobbish ghost who looks like Gudetama joined the Blue Man Group and
became carbuncular with tumors. Where Slimer was joy, Muncher is
depression; where Slimer was sex, Muncher is abstinence; where Slimer
gave his captors a run for their money, Muncher is snail-like; where
Slimer was booze and cocaine, Muncher is ketamine and opioids; and,
most important, where Slimer devoured with hedonistic abandon, Muncher
merely munches.

If Slimer was the Marquis de Sade, Muncher is a basement-dwelling
failson. Sluggish and anhedonic, neutered and soft, the big blue ghost
is the perfect embodiment of our era of permanent decline, in which
every downwardly mobile middle-class American has become lobotomized
by the internet and unsustainable consumption"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
