Why has inequality grown? Hubmer, Krusell & Smith have an answer: 'We
find that the significant drop in tax progressivity starting in the
late 1970s is the most important driver of the increase in wealth
inequality since then'"

Undermining trust in democracy is not cool. As with many other things
this is a leadership fail.

"Biden confirmed that Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty will
be applied to the defense of Okinawa Prefecture and the Senkaku
Islands. Article 5 stipulates that the U.S. is obliged to defend Japan
should its territories come under attack. ... Chinese vessels have
been sighted near the islands"

One of its designers call the Intel 386 instruction set as
"baroque" üòÜ

Yes, bcz the instruction set is simpler, and then bunch of companies
jumped on the bandwagon bcz of the clean design, and it snowballed
from there.

Risc-V is of course open source.

"RISC-V is a new free and open instruction set architecture (ISA)
developed at UC Berkeley, initially designed for research and
education, but is now increasingly being used for commercial designs"

"In two new studies, researchers have used microwaves to produce
hydrogen from plastic waste and water, respectively. ... 

In the new process, the researchers pulverize plastic in a kitchen
blender, mix it with a catalyst made of iron oxide and aluminum oxide,
and then zap it with microwaves at 1000 Watts. The microwaves trigger
the catalyst particles to strip over 97 percent of the hydrogen from
plastic in seconds ...

[For water the] technique involves blasting a ceramic oxide with
microwaves, which removes oxygen from the material and increases its
electrical conductivity. The activated ceramic material then
spontaneously reacts with water that is passed over it, forming
hydrogen and oxygen, which reoxygenates the ceramic so it can be
reused.

LOHC+ as a H2 carrier is no newsflash for govs who know what's going
on.. I've seen docs out of DE, they are all over this shit. EU in
general too. That's what you want... Knowledgable people toiling away
in obscurity and preparing.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
