EEEEVERY HAMLET üò∂ üò∂ üò∂ 

NYT 2013: "Our long-term strategy is to operate the leading news and
advertising media in each of the markets in which we compete‚Äîboth
nationally and locally. The centerpiece of this strategy is extending
the reach of the New York Times‚Äôs high-quality journalism into homes
and businesses in every city, town, village and hamlet of this
country"

"[NYT] has six million subscribers, almost D700 million in cash in the
bank, and a singular insight that underpins the Times‚Äô path forward:
the average number of news subscriptions a news subscriber will have
is one. ...  Local publishers may not believe that they are competing
with the Times, but the Times believes it is competing with them"

The problem probably was over-compartmentalization. "SR is too
advanced", or "it's in this other bucket". He cld refer to elements of
the bucket wout being mired in it, just refer to speed and length
contraction. The bonus is EM becomes crystal clear.

Yes the right-hand-rule biz is helpful for plug-n-chug computation,
but need to mention special relativity while explaining
electromagnetism. Talking to you Resnick. "Particle gets pushed when
it moves". Why? See SR.

Action, scifi movies have been a great source of employment for Arabic
looking people. Need a bad guy with an accent? Talk to Habib

Prof Erica Carlson: "In this physics class you won't be expected to
memorize equations .. this is the information age, you could always
look up information.  [I]nformation is no longer power, it's knowing
what to do with the information"

Here's [Tucker](https://youtu.be/G1UpFHsbOf0?t=1217). Why did he feel
the need to say "he is not some secret socialist".

---

That's right, bcz there are things in Bernie's ideology he is close
to. And Bernie calls himself a socialist. What does that make Trump?

(Hint: not a "right populist")

"During Dem primaries, even before 2016 Trump bashed everyone a lot
except Bernie. I think he liked Bernie"

New figures published today by @energynetworks show that by 2032,
investment in replacing old iron mains gas pipes with new #hydrogen
and biomethane-ready pipes will have taken the equivalent of 526,433
cars off the road since 2014"

A full tank of petrol from my city to London is around ¬£35 and gets my
whole family there. A train ticket is on average ¬£100 per person. If
we‚Äôre serious about the climate, a train ticket should never cost more
than a tank of petrol. It‚Äôs incredibly unaffordable"

"Green hydrogen could be used to significantly reduce aviation
emissions within the next five years, with a complete transition to
hydrogen-fuelled flights from 2050, says new report from Australia‚Äôs
national science agency CSIRO.

Opportunities for hydrogen in commercial aviation¬†had technical input
and funding from Boeing and reports that growing hydrogen industry
momentum could provide an opportunity to introduce hydrogen for niche
airport applications ‚Äì such as ground support equipment ‚Äì as early as
2025"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
