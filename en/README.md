"The canal and its facilities were built by about 900,000 workers
including some 100,000 German POWs and 100,000 gulag prisoners. A day
spent at the construction yard was counted as three days in prison,
which spurred the prisoners to work. Several convicts were even
awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour upon their release"

against Nina Turner. If this continues, the status will go up to

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
