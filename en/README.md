"Texas, with its sprawling petrochemical industry, powerhouse energy
companies and numerous research institutions, could lead the way in
hydrogen adoption"

"You just can’t fill a battery .. any truck that wants over a 500-mile
range, you’re looking at least at a 1,000-kilowatt battery. That’s a
lot of weight. That’s a lot of energy. And to charge it, if you want
to do that in 15 minutes you’re going to need a 4-megawatt
charger. That’s massive and I can only imagine what that looks like
with regards to cable, or just the capacity required to get that
energy to a truck."

Forget 5G. Let's use this.

"University College London (UCL) has recorded the world’s fastest data
transmission speed, reaching 178 terabits a second -or 178,000,000
megabits a second- by using a bandwidth of 16.8 THz.

At double the capacity of any system currently deployed in the world,
the speed was close to the theoretical limit of data transmission set
out by American mathematician Claude Shannon in 1949.

The record was achieved by a research team led by Dr Lidia Galdino
(pictured), lecturer at UCL and Royal Academy of Engineering research
fellow, in collaboration with Xtera and KDDI Research.

Not only did they achieve the speeds – outperforming the previous
record set by researchers in Japan by one fifth – the team also found
such speeds could be deployed on already existing infrastructure.

In 'real terms', 178 terabits a second is so fast it would be possible
to download the entire Netflix library in less than a second.  ..

The record was achieved by transmitting data through a much wider
range of colours of light, or wavelengths, than is typically used in
optical fibre"

In 1968 Carl Sagan was denied tenure at his university. Let that sink
in, CS, one of the best explainers of science, a visible scientific
personality, was denied tenure. They were correct in doing so, "being
an explainer" doesn't mean a research is being furthered in any
front. TAlking to bunch of uninformed people, "popularizing" is not
research. It could be inspiring people, but that's about it. You can't
do science by publicity.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
