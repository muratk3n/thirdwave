Tantrum messaging..? Are they being evil?

"@danieljbaird

Google's intrusive tantrum messaging about not getting their way in
Australia vs the ACCC is pissing me off. Pushing me back to Apple and
other services"

"@TheAgeofShoddy

The degree to which you can get away with shit by looking the part and
speaking convincingly reveals just how much of human society runs on
trust. Best not to gaze too long into that abyss"

Sometimes it feels like there is reality, and there is a make-belief
version of reality where every role in real life is acted out by
someone else. In this bizarro show world, there is a "science guy",
"inventor genius", "politics guru" who play the make-belief versions
of the real characters.

These ppl are full of shit. The problem is when they start believing
their own shit more and more, we might get "policy by celebrity",
policy based on ideas thrown around by fakers, impostors.

"It works on my machine" is the quintessential repsonse to "your code
doesn't work" in IT or other computer based professions, it is now a
running joke.

I laughed at that more than I should..

If things hadn't gotten so bad voters wouldn't opt for a complete
outsider. Experience and endorsements matter to them, they dont know
much abt pol, so ext confirmation is needed. But it is interesting to
see even then, part of the collective subconcious created the
"respected leaders of government asked Trump to run" legend which is
basically what QAnon is about. "He couldn't have been some f-ing
guy!". That is thinking, the hole this consp is trying to fill.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
