Budding cosmologists.. this is where u can make a name 4
yourself. Disprove overabundance of helium, the whole house of cards
will come crushing down.

"‚ÄòPrimordial‚Äô helium levels strongly guide all solar helium abundance
determinations, as the amount of helium in the stars is said to be
closely correlated with the synthesis of this element soon after the
Big Bang. Helium abundances currently act as one of the 'Great
Pillars' of cosmology... As such, any attempt to alter accepted helium
levels within the Sun has great implications throughout astrophysics.
Recently, the author has reviewed the determination of solar helium
abundances and reached the conclusion that these levels are likely to
have been overstated. The most prudent outlook remains that the Sun,
like the visible universe, is composed primarily of hydrogen, as first
outlined by Cecilia Payne"

China‚Äôs use of ... disinformation, economic threats, covert foreign
interference etc. ‚Äî is and will remain the day to day reality of
international affairs in our region. It‚Äôs not the product of a
mishandled China relationship; it is the way Beijing seeks to advance
its interests against countries, like Australia, that do not comply
with its preferences and are active in defending their own.

"Iwatani is [also] exploring the production of 'green hydrogen'
(produced from nonfossil fuels) with KHI and Fortescue Metals Group,
the world‚Äôs fourth-largest iron-ore producer, in
Australia. Additionally, Iwatani is studying the production of green
hydrogen with Australian power company Stanwell"

"Since 1983, [KWI} has developed, manufactured, and operated a
liquefied-hydrogen storage tank at the rocket-launch site facility of
the JAXA Tanegashima Space Center. The hydrogen liquefaction system,
installed in the Hydrogen Technology Demonstration Center at the
Harima Works, has the capacity to liquefy approximately five tons of
hydrogen per day...

KHI and Iwatani Corp ..  are conducting a pilot demonstration for an
international liquefied-hydrogen supply chain using hydrogen produced
from coal in the state of Victoria, Australia. This flagship project
launched in 2015 with subsidization from New Energy and Industrial
Technology Development Organization (NEDO). In 2021, the world‚Äôs first
liquefied-hydrogen carrier, built by KHI, will make its first
round-trip between Japan and Australia. And Iwatani will load, unload,
and store the liquefied hydrogen"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
