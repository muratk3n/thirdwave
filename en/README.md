"Saudi Arabia is constructing a futuristic city in the desert on the Red
Sea called Neom. The $500 billion city — complete with flying taxis
and robotic domestic help — is being built from scratch and will be
home to a million people. And what energy product will be used both to
power this city and sell to the world? Not oil. The Saudis are going
big on something called green hydrogen — a carbon-free fuel made from
water by using renewably produced electricity to split hydrogen
molecules from oxygen molecules. ...

The Saudis aren’t alone in believing it’s the next big thing in the
energy future. While the fuel is barely on the radar in the United
States, around the world a green hydrogen rush is underway"

"Plastic Injection Molding vs 3D Printing ? Which is Better? ... 3D
printing has given engineers the power to create plastic designs at
their desks and bring them to life in a matter of hours. Injection
molding, on the other hand, is the go-to for quality and
value. ... The use of 3D printing in innovative and experimental
scenarios has been grabbing recent headlines, but the reality is that
the majority of today's plastic parts are manufactured using plastic
injection molding"

Sad picture.

TR is not surprising I guess, it is a near-apartheid state where
certain sections of the population are opressed, a permanent morass of
defunct ideologies with a phony national identity, and a leadership
history which never had much spark. The color on the map is well
deserved.

South Africa, well, an actual frickin apartheid, until recently. 

Brasil, Chile make sense. Both countries opress the left, via coups,
hard or soft.

Mexico, drug lords. Largely US' fault.

Most of these centrists are f-ing retarded, that's what I am starting

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
