C++ truly is fast as shit. It's just f-ing raw speed. Close to the metal.

A million particles in a simulation. An early code had >4000 but with
an inefficient O(N^2) which tells me in O(n) setting, that frees up
proc, ~1 Million cld be fine.

Biden was a good candidate. The incumbent was deeply unpopular, and
the election rested mostly on his delivery, but the Biden campaign
provided the ultimate opposite, neutralized the other side's strengths
well.

"A slew of moderate lawmakers, whose wins in the 2018 midterms handed
the gavel again to Pelosi, have lost or are on track to lose their
seats. Meanwhile, several establishment Democrats are set to be
replaced by staunch progressives, shifting Democrats’ political center
of gravity further left in the lower chamber of Congress"

Can we tie (representative) democracy status (a score between 0-10) to
trade barriers -- more democracy gets more trade.

---

Haha DETO instead of NATO? Democratic Earth Treaty Organization. Only
democracies are allowed, members face dismissal if they backtrack on
democracy. Unified defense, increased trade, etc.

They use hair to clean oil spills. Great idea.

"There's a good reason hair gets oily. It's because your hair follicles
have little fat glands that ooze oil onto your hair... Well, now
scientists in Australia have taken a cue from nature to see how well
hair and fur can absorb a different kind of oil - crude oil"

On the face of it, looks fine.. More friends for Israel is a good
thing (I do want them to exist, also plz try to kill less
Palestenians). But if ripping up an existing peace deal caused the
hostility in the first place, then is lining up bunch of allies behind
Israel an unnecessary fix?

Wld US also strategically prefer an ME Cold War? Or have everyone be
in a concillatory / neutral state to both itself, Israel and
eachother?

We cant just do the "out-of-the-ordinary" for the eff of it, or for
tactics. There needs to be some strategic sense to it all.

"But isn't an outsider like Trump a good thing bcz he did the untried,
Israel is now being recognized by many new Arab states"

Third Wave tech is overwhelming Second Wave institutions. IMO to
provide some sort of sanity before the ultimate shift, we need to cut
off the extra noise, otherwise the central institutions will be
bombarded. The noise will do no good anyway -- e.g. Newt sitting in
front of a chatroom w trolls bombarding the singular Speaker.

---

We should remove even the smallest direct-dem practices, along with
referandums, making the whole process to go through
representatives. Remember the California recall election circus?

---

Dont put voters on the spot for issues. Get elected somehow, enact
policy, be reelected on their success.

---

Progs probably did not like that outcome. Be comforted with the fact
that voters dont know much

"Californians overwhelmingly voted in favour of Prop 22, exempting
app-based ride-hailing and delivery services from classifying drivers
as employees eligible for benefits and job protections"

"@gabrielazanfir

For us [at EFF], Prop 24 [allows consumers to prevent businesses from
sharing personal information, etc] is rather a mixed bag of partial
steps backwards and forwards"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
