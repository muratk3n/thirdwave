You cld parse DJT statements all day long, but the moment you question
to legitimacy of an election, and say "fight" somewhere in speech,
that is opening the door to violence. People are not smart on pol
nuance (completely normal), so leadership carries responsibility.

The battery is a circus monkey. It does only one specialized thing
well, its circus trick, but does not play well in an ecosystem
efficiently, effectively. If used, we will be stuck, not to mention
usher in World War 3 on lithium.

The H2 power paste sounds like a fantastic innovation.. shows
potential rewards for betting on the right tech; if car company made
invest in fuel cells, they cld still get ROI from that after a new
delivery method is discovered. Power paste is just another way of
providing H2 gas into the FC, replacing H2 tanks, and everything else
stays the same. Indiv parts get innnovated on seperately = stronger
overall architecture.

"Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology
and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have developed a paste for
hydrogen storage. The institute is calling the mass 'power paste'.

The researchers also claim their paste to offer high energy densities
and be suitable for all vehicles from electric scooters to
cars. According to Fraunhofer IFAM, the power paste, based on the
solid magnesium hydride, should allow hydrogen to be chemically stored
at room temperature and ambient pressure and rereleased as
required. Since the power paste only decomposes above about 250
degrees Celsius, this works without any issues even if, for example, a
scooter equipped with the paste is left in the summer sun for hours.

The storage pasteâ€™s starting material is only magnesium in powder
form, which is a very common element. At 350 degrees Celsius and five
to six times atmospheric pressure, this is reacted with hydrogen to
form magnesium hydride. The power paste is then produced with ester
and metal salt.

The power paste replaces the cylindrical pressure tank used in fuel
cell cars and buses. Therefore, the institute says that this solution
is suitable for hydrogen drives in smaller vehicles in cases where a
pressure tank would be difficult to implement.

According to the Fraunhofer researchers, the refuelling process is
straightforward. Instead of driving to a filling station, the scooter
driver changes a cartridge and fills tap water into a water tank. In
the vehicle itself, the paste is pressed out of the cartridge and
mixed with a precisely measured amount of water, depending on the
required power. This reaction produces gaseous hydrogen, which can
then be converted into electricity for the electric motor.

Only half of the hydrogen comes from the power paste, the other half
from the water in the reaction. 'The energy storage density of the
power paste is therefore enormous: it is much higher than that of a
700 bar pressure tank,' says Marcus Vogt, a scientist at Fraunhofer
IFAM. 'Compared to batteries, it even has ten times the energy storage
density.' The Fraunhofer scientists even say that the driver should
achieve a similar range with the power paste extrapolated to a car as
they would with the same amount of petrol, if not greater"

I dont like these funky math tricks around carbon consumption. I fly
on a polluting plane, but plant a tree, voila I am net zero
emission. This is a hard to manage process. Actors will cheat,
regulation will be hard. We need to kill emissions at the source. Make
flying green, then there is no need to balance anything anywhere.

Vaccine 'jab' of UK english.. always makes me think someone got

But then vaccine 'shot' is similar.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
