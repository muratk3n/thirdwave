That's right there is ejection from the middle of so-called black
holes, outward, even many artistic representation of BH's show
it.. But then how could there be any ejection at all? The f-ing thing
is supposed to pull everything in..

"Biden is tired of dealing with the Middle East — and, barely a month
into his tenure, the region has noticed.

The signals are not meant to be subtle, his advisers say. The
president has made only one call to a head of state in the Middle East
— Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday — which
itself was delayed by more than three weeks and followed calls to
other allies and even adversaries like Russia and China"

True, libs have their own party in UK. 

Jacobin: "A major reason why the US welfare state is so meager, its
union movement so frail, and its working class so divided is that the
United States is the only advanced capitalist democracy where parties
of big business have always monopolized the political arena. The
morbid symptoms of this impasse are everywhere today, from the rise of
Trumpism, to the Democratic establishment’s stubborn opposition to
Medicare for All in the midst of a pandemic, to the deepening
polarization of national politics along partisan lines free from any
focus on redistributing wealth and power.

Identifying this problem, unfortunately, has proven to be much easier
than effectively overcoming it. ...

Like the United States today, the UK had an entrenched two-party
system in which the Liberal Party was politically hegemonic over
workers and their organizations in the late nineteenth century. Aiming
to win over the Libs’ working-class base, socialists avoided the twin
perils of marginalization and co-optation by organizing in and against
the party, building workplace militancy, confronting establishment
Liberals when possible, and allying with them when necessary.

The result was a decades-long dirty break, culminating in the founding
of the Labour Party in 1906 and its displacement of the Liberals"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
