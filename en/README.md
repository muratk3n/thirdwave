If everyone stuck to their side, none of what followed wld be necessary.

But the process had to happen this way I guess..

Reps div is partially due to Dem div many years earlier, if u think
about it.. So weird..

---

A lot of the divisions Trump caused in the Reps remind me of the
triangulation Clinton did in the Dem Party. At the time Reps probably
enjoyed that, seeing the in-fighting in the Dems (until BC started
encroaching on their shit, then they panicked) so what goes around,
comes around, a kind of division hit them too in the end.

She just kept betting on tech, TSLA etc.  People thought this was some
kind of genius but all they did was betting on tech by luck when it
was time for tech (growth stocks). When the situation **turned** they
could not see it coming. Their playbook had one page. They were like
that broken clock showing the right time once a day.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
