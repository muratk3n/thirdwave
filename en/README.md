The docs from the so-called Seasteading Institute are a bloody
mess. Not enough details on engineering. This is what u get when
libertards, economist try to think on substantial
solutions. Friedman's grandson is involved apparently. Focker too.

I don't like moorings. Propellers, already used for mobility, can keep
the structure in place. One issue is this thing is made up of
connected hexagons, some / each with a multidirectional propeller,
they need to be able to point to the same direction. Doable.

But Bruce Wayne is a rich guy and he is trying to help you.. so I
guess in the anti-gov era, this was totally fine. People are there to
be saved by rich people after all. They have status, are better than
everyone else. They can cure disease, offer public services, feed the
poor.

My new notebook keyboard feels like a Mac; it has that solid feel,
slick, but it seems to require a clear intent. Push me bitch! Mean it! ðŸ˜¶
That's the vibe I am getting from this thing. Catty.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
