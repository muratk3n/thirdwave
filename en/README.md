The author's description "junta giveth, junta taketh away democracy"
is spot on.

"The 2008 [Burma] constitution – adopted after a referendum described
as an 'insult' by international rights groups – was a military venture
that instituted a form of tutelage democracy with the military playing
national caretaker. The 213-page document includes several articles
enshrining the military’s 'right to take over and exercise state
sovereign power' in case of an emergency.

Monday’s scrapping of the constitution was, in effect, constitutional"

US plans to start flying B-1s out of Orland Air Base, Norway - the
country's current F-35 hub. 200 USAF personnel showed up there today
to start training to operate the bombers, EUCOM says"

"Award-winning UK scientist Dr. Lui Terry discusses how his pioneering
work on nanoconfinement could help advance the global transition to
cleaner energy... Metallic hydrogen is the densest form of solid
hydrogen - a supremely compact way to store clean fuel. However ... is
classically formed at very high pressures – close to the center of a
planet. Thus, it is energy intense and currently impractical to
produce, but it is predicted to be metastable like
diamonds. Therefore, on removal of the pressure, they remain solid.
[Bristol is] developing an alternative way to increase density at much
lower pressures and higher temperatures .. [w] nanoconfinement"

Obviously I am very much interested in metallic H2, for energy storage

"For astrophysicists, the Sun imparts lessons which may well have
direct applications for mankind. For instance, the solar body holds
the key to fusion. If the Sun is made from condensed matter, then our
experiments should focus on this state. Sunspots may also guard the
secret to synthesizing metallic hydrogen on Earth. If sunspots are
truly metallic, as reflected by their magnetic fields, then attempts
to form liquid metallic hydrogen on Earth might benefit from the
presence of magnetic fields"

Robitaille: "[A]n incompressible liquid, a condensed Sun calls into
question virtually everything which is currently believed with respect
to the evolution and nature of the stars. Should the Sun be condensed,
then neutron stars and white dwarfs will fail to reach the enormous
densities they are currently believed to possess. Much of cosmology
also falls into question, as the incompressibility of matter curtails
any thought that a primordial atom once existed. Aging stars can no
longer collapse and black holes will know no formative mechanism.  A
condensed Sun also hints that great strides must still be made in
understanding the nature of liquids. The Sun has revealed that liquids
possess a much greater potential for lattice order than previously
believed. In addition, lessons may be gained with regards to the
synthesis of liquid metallic hydrogen and the use of condensed matter
as the basis for initiating fusion on Earth"

Fusion has been the Holy Grail of enegy for a long time. But right now
AFAIK the work on it has stalled. They cant get more energy out of it
than the energy they put in. They keep building machines for it but,
like the LHC, the act of building the machine is more exciting,
fruitful than the result u get from the thing itself. That has been
the story so far.

---

It will help us understand the fusion process more. Work on fusion was
inspired by the Sun, so if we understand the Sun better we might do
fusion better.

"Why does it matter to understand how the Sun works?"

U know wha'm talkin but dont you..? Yieeah

What is this free suffix buuulshit

$a_j b_j z_k = x_k + a_i a_i y_k b_j b_k$

is same as

$
(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \mathbf{z} =
\mathbf{x} + |\mathbf{a}|^2 |\mathbf{b}|^2 \mathbf{y}
$

???

Buuulshit

Bitch I much prefer the vector notation..

Sure commercialization can be a form shackling; US de-patented
transistors, then there was a "vibrant ecosystem" around
computing.

Their vacc was available before anyone else's. I bet US / Europe could
do much better wout shackles.

The over-commercialization of biotech led to subpar results.. Too slow.

"Pentagon moves Israel into [CENTCOM] to boost cooperation with Arab

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
