US DOE: "CHP technology can be deployed quickly, cost-effectively, and
with few geographic limitations. CHP can use a variety of fuels, both
fossil- and renewable-based. It has been employed for many years,
mostly in industrial, large commercial, and institutional
applications. CHP may not be widely recognized outside [those]
circles, but it has quietly been providing highly efficient
electricity and process heat to some of the most vital industries,
largest employers, urban centers, and campuses in the United States"

Using electricity from the grid, and w electric heaters producing heat
is a bad, bad idea. The grid is only 40% efficient, elec. heating is
33%, giving you overall efficiency of 13%.

Molecule based transmission is more efficient, use that to generate
both heat and electricity, on site, through this CHP.

---

Either in fossil (turbine) or FC mode, CHP takes the heat that comes
from the internal operation as a side product, and uses it for boiling
water that also provides heat.

"When house owners need a new heating system and oil is no longer an
option due to environmental concerns, then a gas heating system is
considered in most cases. In combination with a fuel cell system,
heating with gas becomes even more efficient and
eco-friendly. Recently, PACE partner Sunfire has launched its new fuel
cell system Sunfire-Home 750, which operates on natural gas or
liquefied propane gas (LPG) and is based on the solid oxide fuel cells
technology (SOFCs)"

In the future, once H2 comes from the gas grid (hopefully green H2),
or portable cylinders, the gas can be fed straight into the unit.

---

[One unit](https://helbio.com/5-kw-combined-heat-and-power-system-chp/)
from Helbio offers 5 KW electric output, 7 kW thermal energy
output in the form of hot water using natural gas, LPG or biogas. It
turns the fuel into hydrogen internally to provide heating and
electricity through a PEM fuel cell. So it "reforms" LPG for instance, creates H2. 


---

There are, one is called CHP, meaning *combined heat and power*.

A CHP unit takes in fuel in gas or other forms, and provides heating
and electricity from this fuel.

"LPG or other gas based ideas sound nice, but are there any packaged
solutions?"

Powell to his credit recently said the real rate is closer to 10.

---

Attempted to replicate the Komlos calculation [here](2019/05/stats.md#unempl).
This is now **my** official unemployment rate.

Says the real rate is 12.52%, while official is 6.3%. Even U6
undercounts, at 11.1%.

---

Economist John Komlos: "[T]he restrictive official definition causes
the unemployment rate to appear to be much less than it actually
is. This implies that a crucial economic variable is systematically
underestimated causing confusion... Inappropriate economic policies
follow from bad data. In addition, the mismeasurement leaves analysts
to wonder why there is so much discontent in a society with full
employment ...

The true unemployment rate consists of the those officially
unemployed, plus half of those who are working part-time involuntarily
since they would like to work full-time, plus those who would like to
work but have not looked for work within the previous month"

I need a more detailed unemployment calculation.

No I dont like the "U6".

---

What is the latest unemployment rate anyway?

---

Bcz I don't give a shit if they work or not.. People already work too
much.

What matters is ppl having healthcare and enough money to spend.

"Why don't you use the term 'working class' in your posts more?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
