"With the notion of systemic rivalry, the European Union hoped to
separate political differences and economic links. In strategic
rivalry, conflict leads. In systemic rivalry, conflict is limited to
the political sphere. It is part of the EUâ€™s political tradition to
believe that politics and the economy can be insulated from each
other...

Over the past two years, [the EU] approved a barrage of new
regulations limiting the Chinese stateâ€™s ability to interfere with the
framework of economic links between the two blocs. These include
investment screening, trade defense instruments, a package against
state subsidies and a public procurement tool...

The deal included significant concessions from Beijing, including a
greater level of market access and disciplines on state-owned
enterprises, transparency of subsidies and rules prohibiting forced
technology transfer. 'By giving us a big gift, they hoped to prevent a
united front with the Biden administration,' the official said.

What surprised China is that the EU never regarded the CAI as a
political agreement. Having forced Beijing to concede on key points,
the bloc did not hesitate to walk over Chinaâ€™s most salient red
lines. On March 22, the EU joined the U.K. and the U.S. in imposing
sanctions aimed at Chinese officials believed to be involved in human
rights violations in Xinjiang province"

Some claim techtonic activity is a necessary ingredient for

now Venus), and Earth is also the only planet with life.

"Ilhan Omar started out in Congress as a somewhat lonely critic of
decades of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Now, six months into her
second term, the Minnesota Democrat has new and diverse allies.

The latest flareup of intra-party frustration with Omarâ€™s progressive
brand of foreign policy appears to have calmed.. While Omarâ€™s recent
comments werenâ€™t as directly disparaging as sheâ€™s been in the past,
Democrats are showing theyâ€™re increasingly comfortable backing her up,
particularly as she hammers the Israeli government in ways that buck
long-held bipartisan traditions in Washington...

'Some may call Congresswoman Omarâ€™s comments harmful or piercing. But
I think theyâ€™re only piercing because weâ€™ve avoided the conversation
for so long. And sheâ€™s not avoiding it,' Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.)
... said in an interview"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
