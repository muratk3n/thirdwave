Jacobin: "Tony Blair Wants to Drag the Left Into His Own Political
Grave... A decade after Blair’s departure from 10 Downing Street, 64
percent of people still had an unfavorable opinion of the man, with
just 21 percent declaring their view to be positive.. His latest
performance comes after a poor set of election results for the current
Labour leader [his boy] Keir Starmer [in an essay] for the New Statesman"

Jacobin: "If nothing else, the COVID-19 pandemic has been an
incredibly instructive case study in what the neoliberal dogma that
now governs our waking lives really means when stripped of artifice or
pretense. As things stand, just a handful of profit-driven private
companies currently control the knowledge and expertise required to
produce vaccines — with people in many poorer countries not expected
to be vaccinated until at least 2024. It didn’t have to be this way,
of course.

Enabled by a monopolistic global intellectual property (IP) regime and
with a tip of the hat to billionaire Bill Gates, Big Pharma and its
political allies have largely succeeded in controlling and defining
the narrative during the early vaccine rollout — transforming the
prospective solution to a global crisis into yet another occasion for
narrow corporate profit, in this case at the expense of public health
and a speedy end to the pandemic"

Reading some early pandemic takes and goddamn does this seem piped in
from a completely separate reality now:

BBC went down hill compared to 10 yrs ago. They used to have great
programs. That weekly discussion among journos on world events w that
Gavin guy.. I dont see anything like that from BBC, at least not on
Net. Plus they mucked up Dr Who it became fully cuck.. Massive loss of
quality there.

The kid at the end is wrong BTW. His great great great great
grandfather was never in Palestine, so could
[not](2020/06/10-myths-israel.md#madonna) have been kicked out by a
Palestenians great great great great grandfather. His great great
great great grandfather was like Madonna, became "interested" in the
religion because it was "something cool". He was learning that, like
Kabala meditation, along with spiritual Taibo while in Booty Bootcamp.

39 years ago, Benjamin Netanyahu began his public career as a deputy
ambassador in talks with a US administration that was negotiating
ceasefires between Israel and the Palestinians. That was in 1982. He’s
now prime minister and it’s 2021 but he’s essentially doing the same
thing"

"@KenRoth

American diplomats reportedly 'will take a new look at the issue of
Israeli settlements in the West Bank.' Good idea. They are war crimes
(Art 49 of 4th Geneva Convention) and an integral part of the Israeli
government's apartheid in the West Bank"

There needs to be accountability after covid. If the scenario I shared
is correct, then, well.. Ok one person involved already got punished,
Trump lost his job.  But Fauci is still there.. The muckmuckers of CCP
are still where they are..

Over three million are dead. HEADS NEED TO ROLL

The protoganist of the witty ME stories, Nasreddin, can just easily be
claimed by Iranianians as by the so-called Turks. The stories
certainly belong to the region, but how much of the region's culture
belongs to the "Turk"?  The answer is - not much.. For Anatolians the
share of the Central As culture is a tiny fraction, basically they are
as much tr as an American is Amish.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
