'We came out here in t-shirts, they started gassing us. We came back
with respirators, they started shooting us. We came back with vests,
they started aiming for the head... And now they call us
terrorists. Whoâ€™s escalating this? Itâ€™s not us.'  @MacSmiff"

DJT net popularity "rose" to -13.6%. Could have been due to change in
general demeanor... Cant keep effin up that badly, that long -- it

600 million ðŸ˜¶

"Daimler and Volvo truck divisions partner on fuel cells. As part of
the deal, Daimler will invest its current fuel cell technology in the
joint venture while Volvo Group will invest 600 million euros
(approximately $652 million), with each entity receiving a 50-percent
stake. Daimler already has a fuel cell vehicle in production, in this
case the Mercedes-Benz GLC F-Cell"

People will pull any ol' category out of their ass wout checking if it
really fits. Like "populism" when they need something that is like
something else but don't want to use that something else in name.

There is no Judeo-Christian identity in US, there is only Christian
identity, and specifically Protestan identity. Even atheists or Jews
or others get it through osmosis.

"Except that tradition never existed.The 'Judeo-Christian tradition'
was one of 20th-century Americaâ€™s greatest political inventions. An
ecumenical marketing meme for combatting godless communism, the
catchphrase long did the work of animating American conservatives in
the Cold War battle. For a brief time, canny liberals also embraced
the phrase as a rhetorical pathway of inclusion into postwar American
democracy for Jews, Catholics, and Black Americans. In a world divided
by totalitarianism abroad and racial segregation at home, the notion
of a shared American religious heritage promised racial healing and
national unity. ... American Jews themselves were reluctant
adopters. After centuries of Christian anti-Semitic persecution and
philo-Semitic fantasies of Jewish conversion, many eyed the award of
an honorary hyphen with suspicion. Even some anti-communist
politicians themselves recognized the concept as ill-suited to
Americaâ€™s postwar quest for global primacy in a decolonizing world.The
mythical 'Judeo-Christian tradition,' then, proved an unstable
foundation on which to build a common American identity"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
