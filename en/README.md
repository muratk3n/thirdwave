I am wary of these pricing, offseting schemes myself.. See vid
below. This is why quashing carbon at its source sounds
better. Renewable fuel comes out of producers, then the rest is
guaranteed to be green. No offseting, no pricing.. The infra of the
world becomes green from top to bottom.

MB has critism for US too when it is called for

Beckley: "Other worrying trends include the fact that the U.S. startup
rate (the share of new firms in the total number) has declined by 50
percent since 1978, and business deaths now outnumber business births
for the first time in generations. American corporate profits are at
all-time highs, but two thirds of U.S. economic sectors have become
more concentrated among a handful of mega firms, a fact that suggests
that rent seeking and price gouging, rather than innovation, caused
the rise in profits. For example, the four airlines that now control
80 percent of the U.S. commercial airline market (compared to 48
percent a decade ago) have profited immensely in recent years by
cramming more passengers onto planes without reducing ticket prices"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
