Different method for $R_t$ estimation.

Saz even Germany has always had $R_t > 1$?

France now,

```
1.13539282
1.13742946
1.1410738
```

"Solutions" like this are based on half-assed reading of futurists
(Toffler). Newt used to babble this shit all the time; like, he'll sit
in front of a chatroom while in Congress, takes "input" from people,
while technobabbling about it "dynamic price discovery, Moore's law,
synergy between hardware and software blah blah". This is not helpful
tech. The singular Speaker of the House in front of a chatroom is a
non-change. If anything you have overloaded this person, with bunch of
unnecessary input which adds to the noise not signal. Chatroom is full
of trollers, they are jumping and down and screaming "his ears look
FUNNNYYYY!", etc it's a mess.

No. This is key; when u apply tech, it needs to cause structural
change. New ed method *replaces* teachers. It doesn't, say, add an
electronic blackboard to an existing classroom, while changing nothing
in the structural content. With an electronic board, there is still
teacher, mostly a dumbass, with questionable teaching ability and
skill, with students having to stand throughout a lecture that is
delivered right there (miss it, too bad). 

"Isn't flipped classroom a mere tech paint?"

Watching a demo dude is like "we have batteries, we charge them!", and
then moves to the freezer, stove, he is like "uh they are propane
powered". ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ The state of this tech is so sad.

Dunno all polls, but if I see model using a specific poll that has
$R^2$ higher than 90%, then not all, but that poll has predictive
power. And net popularity is exactly that. The poll is general and on
a simple enough question that it is not surprising that it works, see
[crowd wisdom](2020/07/crowd-wisdom.md). Within Abrahamovitz model it
is significant, so it is useful on its own.

"Can polls be trusted anymore?"

Even [this method](2019/05/stats.md#unempl) is undercounting it then.

"A person who is looking for a full-time job that pays a living wage â€”
but who can't find one â€” is unemployed. If you accept that definition,
the true unemployment rate in the U.S. is a stunning 26.1%, according
to an important new dataset shared exclusively with 'Axios on HBO.'"

Collated [past notes](2017/10/tax-avoidence-tricks.md) on global tax
avoidence, and ideas. The
[double-dip](2017/10/tax-avoidence-tricks.md#doubleDip) trick is
freaky.

The Times: "No one said that taxing Americaâ€™s technology giants would
be easy. Corralling 137 countries into a fundamental overhaul of
global corporation tax rules was always going to make herding cats
look easy"

If 3W ppl are influential, then, potential problem, the needs of this
crowd not connecting with the general population; White collar ppl
have skills, are on demand. Lots of my past / present collegues /
coworkers are like this, tech talented, so they are always
employed. Then who cares if healthcare is tied to your job? They
always have a job!

---

3W development is nowhere near that yet.. Its arrival is choppy,
representation in terms of people power not too high.

"But wouldn't the presence of white-collar folk be a sign of Third
Wave and within that they could be considered as a class? After all
Second Wave had the blue collar workers and they were a class"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
