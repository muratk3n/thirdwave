Trump talks about giving better healthcare, than hits Biden on
leftism. This is a schizophrenic political discourse. One side of the
political spectrum was delegitimized for too long, and here is the
result.

Epic debate. Sounded like a lot was at stake.

Looking at the timestamps, some claim he knocked that shit out in 20
minutes; 500 lines of code in all. Not bad.

:) A patch submitted to a open-source database project by Assange in
the 90s. Legit geek.

"Denominated in euros". Swell. I wonder if H2 can help turn the Euro
into the global reserve currency...

Oil, plus US military, made dollar the king. A new energy source, like
H2 can do that for the Euro? This time energy is not dug up, but
created by technology. If the tech is supplied to "sunshine countries"
with the promise of selling the produce back, and in Euro, would this
be enough to kickstart a global reserve currency?

The hegemon, could, still theoretically invade but would have a hard
time securing a non-concentrated resource, like was done with
oil? Attacking electrolysers? Harder IMO.

"The¬†European Union¬†has set a target to build 40 gigawatts of
renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030, the equivalent of twice the
capacity of China‚Äôs Three Gorges Dam, the world‚Äôs largest energy
plant. For that, it envisages as much as 470 billion euros of public
and private investments by 2050 and plans to kickstart a global
hydrogen market, allowing the fuel to be traded as a liquid commodity
denominated in euros"

I bet this is why office-dwelling, technobabbling centrist twats like
this shit, a solution for 1 percenters..  I'd send them to Bolivia,
they can create all the coups they want over there to get their
lithium, and live happily ever after. They can do two coups a
day... One in the morning, one in the afternoon. 'I need 50 more kilos
of lithium'. 'Okay, we'll just do a coup, and get 50 kilos'. 

---

What is this, a kumbaya moment? 'Let's hold hands and be
friends?'. Are these people retarded?

If bats are 'part' of the solution, they can only be 1% of the
solution. Not 50%, not 30%, not even 10%. One percent. There isn't
enough lithium in the world for that-plus-that approach. And since 1%
isn't viable economically, the battery option is as good as dead. They
have exactly zero place in the future.

"But every solution can play a role, batteries can be part of the
[energy] solution?"

FCEL won all four? üëç

"FuelCell Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: FCEL)¬†... announces multiple project
awards by the local Connecticut electric distribution companies
... totaling 11.2 megawatts, as part of the state-sponsored Shared
Clean Energy Facility program. Each of the four FuelCell Energy power
plants to be constructed pursuant to these awards will supply 2.8
megawatts of clean power to the Connecticut electric grid"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
