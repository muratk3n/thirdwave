"[A] new chemistry has entered the fray, with battery startup EnerVenue
launching today with $12 million in seed funding.

The company is betting on the success of metal hydrogen batteries,
specifically nickel-hydrogen batteries. This chemistry .. was always
held back from greater commercial success due to its high
price. .. EnerVenue ..  has been able to achieve commercialization via
'a breakthrough competitive price using new low-cost materials.' The
company was able to do this by working with EEnotech, a startup that
incubates and accelerates nanotechnology-driven solutions to, among
other things, grid-scale energy storage. ...

Unlike lithium-ion, the company claims that metal-hydrogen batteries
excel operating in conditions of extreme heat and extreme
cold. Specifically, the solution operates optimally from -40¬∞ to 140¬∞F
ambient temperatures. Because of this, the battery comes with no risk
of fire or thermal runaway and also includes no toxic materials,
making it recyclable, a huge tip in its favor, as recycling of
materials is only going to grow in importance as the renewable energy
industry grows and evolves. ...

EnerVenue claims that the company‚Äôs batteries have a more than 30-year
lifespan, can go through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing
degradation and offer exceptional overcharge, overdischarge, and
deep-cycle capabilities.

The company also claims cost-per-kilowatt-hour as low as a penny, as
well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion. The company
stresses its use of low-cost materials."

"'As an example of metal hydrogen batteries, nickel-hydrogen batteries
have proven to be an incredibly powerful energy storage technology ‚Äì
albeit an expensive one ‚Äì for the aerospace industry over the past 40
years, .. [t]he performance and longevity of nickel-hydrogen batteries
is well-established and second to none. We‚Äôre now able to deliver the
same performance and durability at a breakthrough competitive price
using new low-cost materials.' [says EverVenue founder]."

Math is a tool, we made it up. Infinity is a tool. Imaginery numbers
are a tool. But nature at its core is probably discrete, and math does
connect with nature well. How come?  Well the root of all math is also
discrete -- sets and number theory.

Always good idea to keep tabs on wronged people, resentment, anger for
social analysis and prediction. Ex; Amazon had a pricing war with
diapers.com, put them out of business. Its founder started a new thing
acquired by Walmart, he now works for Walmart and *runs all their
U.S. e-commerce operations*. This guy must be PISSED, and now in a
position to even the score. His business was destroyed by Amazon now
he works for the competitor. U watch this guy and his drama.

MSM gaslights bcz if they talked abt what is truly going on, then
someone could ask 'well how the f--k did left issues end up in the
GOP, why are they not in the Democratic Party?". That is too close for
comfort now.. Then you have to talk about how centrism fucked up for
decades, how unwanted ideological parts landed with a random outsider
who brought it to the GOP.

The gaslighting on Russiagate serves the same purpose. If DJT win
wasn't through "illegal means", then the next question is how did this
guy win legally?

We've been in second wave for three centuries now. Given that
structure, there can't be too many wildly, untried solutions. The
means of production dictates certain disconnection, disparate parts
needs to be reconnected, through integrators, implying government,
that needs taxes. The natural next question is *how high* taxes?

Someone says low, someone says high. Two options.

After 2016 the talk was abt this "brand new politics", "right
populism". So I waited to hear details... Bannon for example. U
wait.. U wait.. then boom -- word came out he wanted high taxes on the
rich.

That's left bitch!

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
