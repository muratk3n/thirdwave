This is the inventor of the [model](2015/04/predicting-2016-presidential-election.md) I use.

Abrahamovitz: "We can now update the forecast from the simplified
model based on the latest measure of President Trump‚Äôs approval
rating. ... Based on a net approval rating of -12% in the most recent
Gallup Poll, the model now predicts that Joe Biden will receive 344
electoral votes to 194 for Donald Trump. The model now gives Biden an
86% chance of winning the electoral vote"

Nov 1 is here, and the answer is 67.7% of the 2016 total votes have
already been cast. Over 100% in TX and HI, 90+% in at least 7 more
states"

If you're called antisemitic for criticizing Israel just say the
criticism is something you got from your Jewish friend, who said that
to not criticize Israel is antisemitic. It's me, I am your Jewish
friend. Every uncritical sentence you utter on Israel is
antisemitic. There. :)"

I wonder if a generation of monitor-starers having irreversably lost
their contact from the physical world played a role in the bad design
choice here. "It's just code bro!". 

---

The design was not robust. They tried to fix in software what they
should have fixed in hardware.

"@davidsirota

The Overton Window has moved so far to the right that the debate over
health care during a pandemic is only over whether or not to help
insurance companies economically punish sick people for the crime of
being sick"

Alex Jones saz Trump cut off external lobbyists but then his circle
was carpetbombed with money so they became lobbyists indirectly
(\#rogan podcast). Could be true.. If so, good observation. See,
if this man is cut off due to (IMO) weird climate change denialism,
then you miss out on the occasional good observation. Censoring is bad

Cant go to the movies? Movie theathers were overrated anyway...

2W was about
[synchronization](2011/03/fundamentals-of-industrial-ideologies_synchronization.md);
in entertainment, in production, in ed. There can still be a place
called school, somewhere outside of home, kids are dropped off useful
for cases when home env is stressful, but ed itself will be be
asynch. Class would not "start" or "end" -- kid simply goes and picks
up tablet and continues where he left off from the previous day. A
librarian type person / certifier can make sure place is suitable for study

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
