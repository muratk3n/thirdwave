There are so many things to compute. Fantastic models out there that

They have to care, there is a whole song and dance around creation of
particles, formation of heavier elements since the "beginning of

Strategically it wld also make sense to want to be depended upon by
bigger players, as an energy exporter, so next time maybe they wont
get their ass kicked that swiftly by Russia.

Quick term expl; they will use water (hydro) in a dam, let through

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
