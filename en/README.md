What do I think of Hollande of FR?

Whenever I get these questions, I always check a person's Epstein
number first.

[Picture \#3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgPe-HTWkAAKbbl?format=jpg&name=small).

So Hollande's Epstein number is 3.

He is okay I guess, a so-so character.

The B-word.. Oh no.

Next you'll hear we need "Team of Rivals" approach for governance.

"@sargoth

I don't know who needs to hear this, but when US politicians say
"bipartisan", you are never one of the parties involved'

"Any global investor, or would-be innovator, might gaze across at the
ice wall of patent knowledge surrounding US tech companies and
conclude it cannot be breached. ...  But ice walls melt and legal
systems can turn on technology monopolists. That happened to Thomas
Edison with movie patents, AT&T with telephony"

US violated its own rule that it followed since WWII by creating such
a strong relationship with a non-democracy. There were strong ties
with Japan, Germany, Europe -- all democracies after WWII. 

"But US made China favored, why shouldn't it help a country?"

"@MilesMJohnson

This is a riveting account of Dan’s epic Wirecard reporting that
should drive home the fact that there are legions of libel lawyers,
spin doctors and dark arts specialists being paid millions to muzzle
investigative journalism in the UK"

They delegitimized entire swaths of political spectrum. But the need
for those views didnt go away. The unwanted parts just moved
elsewhere, morphed, came together in unseeming ways and became
Brexit.

If they didnt do Red Ed, maybe now they wouldnt have a Tory PM who
said "fuck business".

They did this. The situation today is their punishment.

Ahhh.. The crazy work of the rowdy British press.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
