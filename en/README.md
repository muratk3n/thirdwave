violent demonstrations that have reignited the fuse of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict"

"istanbultelaviv

These organized groups are being also led by the Jewish supremacist,
MP Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is currently on his way to Lod with hundreds
of supporters... The police cannot block him.. Just a few nights ago,
they burnt down Arab businesses"

Jacobin: "Last month, Washington State passed a capital gains tax
aimed at the state's ultra-wealthy. The tax is historic because
Washington, despite its progressive reputation, until now had the
worst tax code in the nation when it comes to fairness, behind Texas,
Florida, and South Dakota"

Wrote little browser tool w `bs4` to filter out all visual elements of
a page leaving the plain text behind. Great for low bandwidth
browsing. Intermittency. Raw content over presentation. Da thing

Despite the general centrist, establishment stance not sure CNN is
overly fond of Israel.. One reporter had a very public spat there
years back. I think the whole Netanyahu shtick, the Sheldon Adelson
connection, right-wing fuckery is a bit too much, even for them.

Dupe the intl press, then destroy the AP building.. The coverage can

NYT: "A spokesman led the international media to believe that Israeli
forces had entered Gaza. They hadn't. But the army wanted Hamas to
think they had.. The intent, the media reports said, was to dupe Hamas
fighters into thinking that an invasion had begun and to respond in
ways that would expose far greater numbers of them to what was being
called a devastatingly lethal Israeli attack.... [MSM...] had
mistakenly reported a ground invasion early Friday [asked] whether
they had been turned into accessories to the military, why it had
taken hours for the invasion report to be reversed, and how they would
be able to trust the military's statements going forward"

"In 1949, a Polish Holocaust survivor named Genya Kowalski was offered
a Palestinian house in Haifa. She refused, saying: 'I don’t want to
live [in a house] of people who were thrown out...a human being is a
human being.' We can be her heirs today" via @samseder

Jacobin: "Biden administration’s economic experts have been
spotlighting the basic facts showing that the economy is functioning
normally and private-sector pay has not unsustainably spiked. In fact,
average hourly earnings increased from March to April by less than the
rise in the consumer price index — which suggests there is less of a
worker shortage, and more a shortage of employers willing to increase
pay even a little bit. For his part, President Joe Biden has
thankfully shed his past Reagan-appeasing habits and has avoided
echoing his own old 'welfare queen' language. But ... his rhetoric is
now starting to subtly shift from calling out GOP bullshit to trying
to accommodate it"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
