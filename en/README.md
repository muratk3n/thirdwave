France 24: "Glimpse of a post-Covid future? Masks ditched as Gibraltar
nears total vaccination... Signs reminding people to wear a face mask
in public were taken down by workmen in Gibraltar on Sunday in the
latest indication that life is slowly returning to something close to
normal in the small British overseas territory. Gibraltar is one of
the first places in the world to have vaccinated virtually its entire
adult population against Covid-19 and may now offer a clue as to how
other nations will fare when their own populations are inoculated"

My approach allows for it..  We cant rule out schools tho, or "that
other place where kids can go to outside their home", or whatever it
may be called in the future, bcz it doubles as a daycare center for
many working parents (the pandemic made this clear), and especially in
poorer neighborhoods, if there is trouble at home, etc it can work as
a sanctuary of sorts, kids go there, to a well-known place where other
adults are present.

"But a lot of new ed approaches are around homeschooling, why aren't
you for homeschooling?"

UCDP Feb 2021 data is out.

Looking at IS activity. First total is incidence count, other is
deaths total.

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
df = pd.read_csv('https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/candidateged/GEDEvent_v21_0_2.csv')
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 20)
df1 = df[(df['side_a'] == 'IS' )]
print (df1[['side_b','deaths_b','country']].\
      groupby(['side_b','country']).\

I realized Seshat data file had some columns "scaled", so they dont reflect
the raw value. Where is the raw value? I find the orig, but it has columns
seperated to *rows*. Woha. Scrubbing now.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
