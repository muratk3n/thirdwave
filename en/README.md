"In a nutshell, the natural geological process of scrubbing carbon
dioxide from the air works like this: carbon dioxide dissolves into
rainwater, which then falls on rocks. Over time, rocks absorb carbon
dioxide, consuming the gas and creating a mineral-based bicarbonate
akin to baking soda that gets washed into the ocean. As effective as
it may be, it’s also a glacially slow process that can take hundreds
of centuries, Kelland notes. 'We don’t have 100,000 years to fix this
problem,' he says. 'How can we speed that process up? Effectively,
that's what our process does.' Planetary Hydrogen’s patented system,
dubbed SeaOH2, uses an electric current to split ocean water molecules
into hydrogen and oxygen.

Known as electrolysis, that process isn’t groundbreaking in
itself. But by adding a mineral salt to the electrolysis cell, the
company’s engineers have created an atmosphere-scrubbing compound
called mineral hydroxide as a waste product. The hydroxide binds with
carbon dioxide, effectively “capturing' the greenhouse gas while
producing hydrogen as a potentially lucrative byproduct"

"@Dr__Dix

I just taught a class where only 5 students showed up, none of them had their cameras on, and only 1 student spoke when I asked questions. 

Y'all I had videos, gifs, activities. I came with smiles and jokes. 

It was the most dejected I have felt while teaching in the pandemic.

@rockswhisperer

I went with Asychronous recorded lectures. Watch when it is convenient
for you. I use the lecture time for come in if and when you need
help. Do you really need to be in class at 9 AM to hear me...or does
watching a recording at 11 pm work for you and your career goals...

@AnnieBode1

this asynchronous stuff is working great for my son. He is a night owl

@stefan_seuring

I also use pre-recorded lectures and have good feedback from students"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
