Chile scraps their 80 Consitution? Their diktat is usually compared to
TR fascism, w its human-rights vioations, on the left
especially. Pinotchet is compared to Evren, and their consitution must
be just as bad, 80 and 82 respectively, ultra capitalist, fascist docs
in essence. TR fascism is still around sadly

Let it rip

"Banks may have to brace for heavy losses as commercial property
prices plunge... Commercial real estate prices have plunged this year
as people stopped going into offices, and retail businesses were
disrupted. That could lead to a significant losses for banks,
according to a recent report"

It is my professional duty to note again that, no matter its
popularity in some circles, 'the top 10% pays 70% of income taxes' is
a meaningless statistic. If the top 10% earned 100% of all income it
would pay 100% of all income taxes"

"@ggreenwald

There is no question -- none -- that mainstream US news outlets
disseminate more unhinged, unproven conspiracy theories -- and do far
more damage with them -- than QAnon, or whichever fringe group they
want you to focus on, can achieve in 1,000 years"

If one has certain [socdyn ability](2015/07/mesquita-game-theory.md#inborn),
an idea is to use it to find good anchor points, calculations, measurements, lit,
and use that to build more know-how around. Can lead to more replicatable
results and might even to something resembling science. I did this bcz
lack of mathematics in socials sciences is repulsive for 1, and wanted
to be as hands-off as possible (refs for everything). It works.

[Standardization](2011/03/fundamentals-of-industrial-ideologies.md).. üëé

The Independent, 2015: "Schools are using 'dubious practices' and even
cheating to achieve better performance results because of the intense
pressure of the Government‚Äôs test and exam system, a major study for
the largest teaching union has found. ...

The study concluded there was 'evidence that teachers in England are
‚Äògaming the system‚Äô, because they are under pressure to achieve good
results. In some cases they are being told to cheat. Such practices
are increasing in response to the intense pressure on school leaders
and teachers to raise attainment as measured by tests and exams.'"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
