It doesn't. Clinton years and later events proved this creates its own
[polarization](2018/05/polarization.md). The other party will
radicalize on second-order issues, even solvable stuff will remain
unsolved. My stance remains; distinct ideologies need to be
represented in two or more distinct parties. No centrism. No fascism.

"Then being lukewarm on all issues should work?"

On the surface of it all "whatever it takes" approach could look
appealing -- but if the leader says "sometimes I go to right,
sometimes left" the question becomes "who decides in which instance
this happens?" The leader himself. This raises the issue of
arbitrariness, reduces predictability, noone can place this person
anywhere, that creates problems. 

"Why don't people like a mix of distinct left and right within the
party / person?"

In many other aspects of consumption we replicate quality for all; my
average priced TV monitor works at a certain expected quality, same
for me and everyone else who buys that monitor. Why do we insist on
seeing education as something different, as if it is not a product,
and student (ed consumer) A can get the highest quality, but B has to
settle with obscenely bad quality, and there is nothing (!) we can do
about it.

That's smart of them

"@Artemis_K_

I find it so weird that students aren't using their camera. I haven't
had one show themselves in tutorials since the semester started"

A tablet could carry / access all top-notch teaching on all subjects
in the world. We don't need teachers in the old sense of the
word. Flip all classes. Record everything. Async delivery of content
is key, preferably by select few who know and can teach the subject the best.

Hi-tech paint job on an old system.. bound for failure.

True. The changes are so tiny, but we can detect that shit, and "hear"
stuff through it.. Amazing. Another proof that our 'sensors' are
incredibly well attuned to changes (we may not see in the dark, but
detect movement, even with the corner of our eye).

"However, the crucial thing is that usually fluids don’t change their
volume very much. It’s next to impossible, even with an incredibly
powerful pump, to change the volume of water much at all. Even air
won’t change its volume much unless you stick it in a pump, or are
dealing with really extreme situations like sonic booms and blast
waves.  The study of how fluids behave in these situations is
generally called “compressible flow”. It’s complicated and expensive
to simulate, and apart from acoustics doesn’t enter much into everday
life. And even sound waves are such tiny perturbations in the volume"

There was a rise in immigration, closest such numbers were seen was
during 1800s. 

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('foreignb.csv',sep='\t')
df = df[['Year','Percentage of Foreign-Born']].set_index('Year')
df.plot()
plt.savefig('atw_01.png')
```

![](atw_01.png)

However, there was a steady increase since mid-70s continued to this day.

Interesting; wage increases also stalled since then. Correlation?
Causation?

Automation and outsourcing would play a role here too..

But a company would think *why not twice that*? The last mov could
have grossed 2 billion, which *Endgame* did, the work of a franchise
that did not even exist a decade ago.. Also DSW merc sales are
abysmal, a sign that people are not excited about the Woke
direction.

Disney knows it too; word is K. Kennedy, the Disney exec behind the
new direction is sidelined.

"Why do you say Disney Star Wars was unsuccesful? One of them grossed
a billion"

No new major war or intervention for the past four years.. When was
the last time that happened? Carter?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
