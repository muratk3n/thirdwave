"Amid the Shooting, Netanyahuâ€™s Foes See an Opening, and
Risks... Israeli politicians often close ranks in a crisis, but this
time the prime ministerâ€™s enemies, trying to form a government and
oust him, are blaming the violence on him"

The country needs insiders, not outsiders.. dividers, not uniters.

With Trump exiting the "outsiders" wave took a hit.. That whole sales
shtick starting with people copying Jesse Ventura until 2020 showed
the outsider has no silver bullet.. I asked bunch of Californians the
other day abt Ahnuld, they said 'he didnt fix the budget issue' (the
issue that led to Gray's recall and his election), due to his ideology
apparently.. Well then how is that different from any other small-gov
anti-tax politician? Trump had some good but made bunch of
mistakes.. All in all, more experience is better.

We need less direct democracy, not more. As long as modern
institutions exist, no need to hobble them with too many "people
intrusions".

I support recalling the recall law. 

"The recall election coming later this year for California Governor
Gavin Newsom doesnâ€™t appear likely to end with his removal from
office. Although Newsomâ€™s opponents have gathered enough signatures to
require a voteâ€”and conditions in the state could still changeâ€”polls
show that public support for the effort is far below what Newsomâ€™s
critics will need to force his removal.Nevertheless, the drive may
trigger another form of recall: It may finally prompt California to
examine whether the 110-year-old state law that governs recalls still
makes sense in our modern era of unrelenting partisan conflict. The
law was instituted during the Progressive era as a tool to tame
special interests, but the effort against Newsom suggests that itâ€™s
become a weapon of harassment and manipulation by Republicans"

Her comments drew a barrage of criticism.

'She canâ€™t even say the word Palestinian,' one Twitter user commented
in reference to Gadotâ€™s post"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
