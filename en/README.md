Because that would be a disincentive for EU members to stay / be in
the EU.  If they felt their pieces would just be taken in seperately
after membership, countries would have less of an incentive to be a
member. But, if you are __not__ in the EU like the UK is not anymore,
especially after a bad divorce like the one UK had, then EU could be
like "fine, come on in, in pieces, whatever".

"Why would EU care about pieces of countries joining to it, or not, like Catalonia?"

Waited until org agro to have spices in cooking..?  Foragers cld have
figured that out.. They knew fire, they cooked meat (cooking softened
it, allowing more of it to be eaten in one sitting, more energy), they
also foraged for plants obviouly, and a few wld have figured to throw
in some bay leaves in there in the pot along with water. Sounds
plausible to me.

Long thread.. the rest calls cryptos 'Ponzi schemes'. In a certain

"@smdiehl

Bitcoin's narrative is crystallized around alt-right populism, a
strange variant of Austrian economics, goldbuggery, distrust of
institutions and resentment about the 2008 financial crisis.  While
Dogecoin is basically built around pure nihilism"

Mistakes here, mistake over there.. There is difference in scale
here. Their ppl did not say 'we are all Amish' and one founder did not
change his name to George GrandAncestorAmish. You are not comparing
apples and oranges at this point, but apples with.. hoola
hoops. Doorknobs.. That is the sad truth.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
