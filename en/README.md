The longer we take to extinguish this virus, the more opportunities we
give it to mutate, to evade our immune system, and possibly to even
evade a vaccine"

Rapaport, *The Art of Molecular Dynamics Simulation*: "Modeling of
matter at the microscopic level is based on a comprehensive
description of the constituent particles. Although such a description
must in principle be based on quantum mechanics, MD generally adopts a
classical point of view, typically representing atoms or molecules as
point masses interacting through forces that depend on the separation
of these objects. More complex applications are likely to require
extended molecular structures, in which case the forces will also
depend on relative orientation. The quantum picture of interactions
arising from overlapping electron clouds has been transformed into a
system of masses coupled by exotic ‚Äòsprings‚Äô. The justification for
this antithesis of quantum mechanics is that not only does it work,
but it appears to work surprisingly well; on the other hand, the
rigorous quantum mechanical description is still hard pressed in
dealing with even the smallest systems"

What did I ask the honcho earlier? It was abt a particular style of
molecular dynamics computation. There is always approximation
involved, but there are many places to do that. For pairwise
interactions, fast access to neighborhood is needed, but is it enough
to get most neighbors? Well for this particular method, you have to
get __all__ neighbors. So says honcho. It will be followed.

But by all means *sell* through the new tools. One-sided.

I meant filtering on their end, obviously. Dont censor. Self-filtering
will do. It will take discipline... relying on existing media, a few
big papers. I dont think following some random dude on the net is
beneficial frankly, and that includes me. Trump both used and consumed
socnet vociferously, but in the end, was it a net benefit to him and
his presidency?

WTF? I had a question in my mind, at that moment received a follow,
the follower (a company) had a recent tweet which had the exact answer
I was looking for. üò∂ Spooky.

Against EU-RU alliance, same as Trump. See [here](2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.md#eurasia)

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
