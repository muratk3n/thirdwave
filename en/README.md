One cld argue either sanction fully or not at all. Fully meaning
forcing all outbound shipments, flights to go through certain hops,
inspecting them.

Did sanctions push them into the drug trade or the reason was economic
mismanagement? More of the latter wld be my guess.

Plus notice how batteries are not even part of the discussion. That's
because it is inferior tech.

"Fuel repurposed from waste or organic sources"? You could say the
same for kerosene "repurposed from organic, dead dinaseurs". Or does
net-zero mean producer of the fuel just plants bunch of trees
balancing bad pollution with good trees?

You are barking up the wrong tree.

"Several startups are racing to get supersonic planes flying
again... United and Boom also want to make these flights
environmentally friendly, promising that these flights will be
'net-zero carbon from day one,' and rely completely on sustainable
aviation fuel, which is repurposed from waste or organic sources"

Scholze is a rising star, hell already a star, in mathematics. Good to
hear confirmation on tools like Lean from him. Computer-aid in any
field is a good thing.

Peter Scholze: "I find it absolutely insane that interactive proof
assistants are now at the level that within a very reasonable time

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
