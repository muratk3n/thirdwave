Same reason the US Chamber of Commerce briefed against
it. International IP rules benefit almost all US big business. This is
an existential issue for them that goes well beyond Covid. Any
precedent for suspending those rules will be fought tooth and nail.

the emergency proposal to share vaccine technology. Why? There's a

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
