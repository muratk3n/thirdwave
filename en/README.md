Why did Sharon pull out of Gaza unilaterally in 2005? The narrative at
the time was "yielding Gaza would help promote goodwill and peace".
But when did anyone leave territory without anything substantial in
return?

We also know Hamas is an [Israeli creation](2020/06/10-myths-israel.md#hamas).

Put the two together.. maybe Israel wanted that persistent flashpoint
to fight against, to keep the right mobilized, and militarized, and
always show the international crowd they are "under attack", so they
could continuously play the victim. It is unbelievable such a tiny ass
area can give Israel so much grief, to the extent ppl tremble behind
some "Iron Dome", hide in shelters everytime there are attacks.

Whenever I see B Johnson on TV giving interviews nowadays he is always
in those yellow colored workman's clothes.. Let's guess on what kind
of image he is trying to project.. Courting low-income Labour votes
maybe..?  Centrists.. where are you?  Fell asleep at the wheel..?
Opposite BJ there is the lawyer looking guy not too comfortable with
retail politics.. Leave aside pol this is bad optics.

considered public service right, its government?).

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
