"On Sunday, the Turkish DNA Project took to Twitter to call on Turks to
boycott Ancestry.com, the largest for-profit genealogy company in the
world, after results on the website highlighted how non-Turkish groups
in Anatolia assimilated over time into modern Turks"

The devoutness signal can also be used a means to stratify, create
hierarchy in society. If someone buys in, into something this out of
whack, which by the very nature of its whackiness *surely* leaves out
certain people, then you automatically are creating yourself an
"in-crowd". It's like a college fraternity, who is allowed in? The
pledge who puts panties on his head runs around half-naked screaming
"I am from outerspace" while riding a broom. That's the guy you want,
right? He is signaling he *really* wants to be in the club.

Tigger national narrative being so broken creates many unwanted
side-effects. Because the narrative is bizarre, only the most devout
can buy into it wholesale. Then higher-ups can use that buy-in as a
signal, to weed out normals, allowing in fanatics. Those fanatics you
can direct anywhere, to your mafiatic organizations, extrajudicial
killings, whatever.

Kemal himself was born and raised in Thessaloniki BTW, in today's Greece.

He sure as shit didn't look Asiatic.

It's true.. for someone who wanted science based, pro-Western reforms,
Kemal was pretty [unscientific](2021/05/anatolia.md#unscientific) in
his approach to history.

"[There] is an effort led by Secretary of Energy Ken Wagner to drive
commitments of $1 billion of investment to develop a hydrogen fuel
industry in Oklahoma. Such an industry could yield investments in new
power and processing plants, retrofitting existing gas power plants,
pipeline expansion, fuel storage, trucking company opportunities and
carbon sequestration.

'As of right now, itâ€™s my No. 1 priority,' Wagner said. 'This is the
one technology that is complementary to all of our best resources. (â€¦)
I think the long-term impact is tremendous.'"

Much interaction between peoples.

Grillo, *Pluralism and Politics of Difference*: "From the seventeenth
centuiy, [the Ottoman] *millet* [a system whereby peoples usually
grouped under religion, eg. Armenian millet] was 'probably current' in
the offices of the central government... In sum, then, *millets* were
institutions which were quite heavily organized at the top and at the
centre (in Istanbul) and thus 'existed' in some sense from the point
of view of the bureaucracy and their own leaders. In the towns and
villages of the provinces, however, the form of the institution, and
the degree of institutionalization varied greatly; in some places they
must scarcely have existed at all"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
