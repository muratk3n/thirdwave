OSM is a great piece of software and data..

The Guardian: "OpenStreetMap looks to relocate to EU due to Brexit
limitations... Open-source UK tech company cites copyright issues,
rising costs and prospect of more influence in EU. OpenStreetMap, the
Wikipedia-for-maps organisation that seeks to create a free and
open-source map of the globe, is considering relocating to the EU,
almost 20 years after it was founded in the UK by the British
entrepreneur Steve Coast"

questions.' Within hours he was proven right"

Plus if it looks like SCOTUS is playing ball, that'd be less of a reason
to ponder packing the court.

I wonder SCOTUS cons started protecting Obamacare to stave off
something worse (for them).

Events in Egypt showed the weakness of 'political people power'
argument.. These "Twitter, Facebook uprisings" resulted in
dictatorship.

Institutions matter..  After the Tahrir protests and fall of Mobarak,
one of the few organized actors were the M. Brotherhood, which weren't
representative, nor experienced enough to lead Egypt anywhere. In fact
MB themselves were the result of the monkey show Mobarak put out there
to lull the West into thinking he had an opposition. But when MB
actually took power it was apparent they lacked the necessary support,
and culture to bring about change.. Then they were taken down by the
other institution more entrenched than theirs, the military, while the
man on the street cheered on.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
