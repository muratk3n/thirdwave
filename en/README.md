According to [EIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) ,
estimated world energy consumption was 157,481 Terrawatt Hours in 2013.

```python
consumed = (157481. / (365*2)) * 1e9 # Kwh
print ("%d mil. tons" % (consumed / 70.0 * 60.0 / 1e9))
```

```text
184 mil. tons
```

Storing today's energy consumption for half a day requires over ten
times the amount of available lithium in the world.

Unfortunately for its rabid following this route is dead. The tech has
no future. Hell, it didn't even have a present based on these numbers.

Exactly. And we should be ready for that. Plus that 10 KW number
itself will grow, for everyone.

Leaving that aside, even today's energy requirements are out of reach
for bats

"You said lith mines aren't enough.. But [10 KW per
person](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2020/07/h2-numbers.html#lithium)
energy consumption is based on everyone consuming in US standards"

People making movies don't necessarily understand what they are
making, in the analytical sense. Art connect at many levels, one of
that is emotion, which is below analytical thinking. Then movie makers
connecting to that, then, also go through their own
subconcious. George Lucas thought he was making a movie with
allegories to Nazi Germany, Vietnam, Nixon, but he ended up making a
movie about early Christians and Rome. TV show *Lost* looked like an
existential drama, pondering the afterlife, or abt nothing at all with
random people running around through a confusion-made-cool wizardry,
but *Lost* is actually about humanity's hunter-gatherer experience,
and ills of modernity.

Chris Hedges: "The Democrats and their liberal apologists adopt
tolerant positions on issues regarding race, religion, immigration,
women's rights and sexual identity and pretend this is politics. But
these issues are societal or ethical issues; they are important, but
they are not social or political issues. The seizure of control of the
economy by a class of global speculators and corporations has ruined
the lives of the very groups the democrats pretend to lift up. When
Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party for example destroyed the old
welfare system 70% of the recipients were children. Those on the right
of the political spectrum, and we must never forget that the positions
of the Democratic party would make it a far right party in Europe,
demonize those on the margins of society as scapegoats. The culture
wars mask the reality both parties are full partners in the
destruction of our democratic institutions, both parties have
reconfigured American society into a mafia state"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
