More ineffective tech paint job that fails to do the job. I bet

"@mh4oh

For the second time in 3 weeks, law enforcement in Columbus, Ohio have

"The lack of options marketed to consumers has created a missing
middle: the zone between mass market and niche market where
experimentation is supposed to proliferate and engender
variety. Worse, the consolidation of the country’s vast creative
sector into fewer, more powerful production and publishing companies
has come at the direct expense of the quality of their product. The
coronavirus isn’t the reason *Tenet* sucked, for example. It just
sucked because Christopher Nolan has too much power, and very few
other people in his industry have enough.

This homogenization of the arts is a refutation of the idea that
capitalism produces true competition. Instead, we are entering a peak
era of market monopolies, where a group of huge corporations, many of
which trade in personal data, also have a stranglehold grip around the
neck of every non-megastar artist in the country"

"@newrepublic

Billion-dollar book companies like Follett and EBSCO are locking
school districts into contracts that turn them into captive consumers,
draining public education budgets that don’t have a penny to spare"

If senate majority is back for Dems I hope they repeal the filibuster
rule for everything.

Would an insufficient covid bill help or hinder Georgia state runoff
elections for Dems? 🤔 If Dems can pin the insufficiency on Reps, wld
it help them win those seats?

"Today, Senator Thom Tillis launched a 'discussion draft' of
the so-called Digital Copyright Act. But there's nothing to discuss:
the bill, if passed, would absolutely devastate the Internet.

We’ll have a more in-depth analysis of this draft bill later, but we
want to be clear about our opposition from the start: this bill is bad
for Internet users, creators, and start-ups. The ones with the most to
gain? Big Tech and Big Content"

Noone seems to like Bruce Reed over on the left corner known as an

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
