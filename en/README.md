Bernie getting the cold shoulder from Democrats on direct aid to
starving people and then having to find one random maverick Republican
(Hawley) to then force at least something into the bill is a parable
about the entire grotesque bipartisan political class that owns
Washington"

lots-o-curves mystery is one thing, this is another.

"@CoriBush

I refuse to normalize an anti-democratic process where a few rich,
predominantly white individuals negotiate behind closed doors for most
of 2020 and give the rest of us a few hours to consider the 5,593 page
result of their secret negotiations"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
