Uhhh uhh he said 'baseload'

"Within the context of our energy landscape, where we‚Äôve typically been
forced to choose between 'clean' and 'baseload,' fuel cells are
something of a paradigm shift: Fuel cells mean we can deliver reliable
baseload power without burning any fuel. We can reliably power a city
or a factory, while outputting virtually zero NOx or SOx emissions. We
can finally have it both ways, or as some might say, 'have our cake
and eat it, too'"

So much plastic waste.. I bet u go anywhere in the world today, to a
deserted island even, and waste would find you. That Hanks character
on *Cast Away* today would only have to wait until he collected enough
plastic bottles by way of sea, then just McGyver a freaking super boat
and GTF outa there

Still against fracking, creates harm at the source that no tech can
fix. Plus there is flaring, etc..

Im fine w blue, or gray H2, ammonia..

My whole angle here is enticing fossil comps into clean fuel, and make
up the H2 production shortfall if there are any, at least in the
beginning.

A clean fuel's very presence would ensure zero emission all the way
down the pipeline, including the end user.

If policy maker can work the knobs in a way we get massive green H2
generation now, fine. Politicking: how much of a pain in the ass can
fossil ppl can get, better off with them or without them? That's their
job to manage.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
