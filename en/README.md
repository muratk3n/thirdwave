Lynne O'Donnell on ABC: "Taliban is the biggest drug cartel in the
world".

Other comments were interesting, on poppy production, how Taliban
moved in AFG (started from South, spread elsewhere, following the
fields)

That's not how it works.. One general approach, the one that is
simplest, do the most with least will dominate. H2 can replace that
84%. Batteries cannot. There isn't enough lithium in the world
[for it](2020/07/h2-numbers.md#lithium).

Forbes: "Fossil Fuels Still Supply 84 Percent Of World Energy..  as an
overall share of energy consumption, oil remained on top with 33% of
all energy consumption. The remainder of global energy consumption
came from coal (27%), natural gas (24%), hydropower (6%), renewables
(5%), and nuclear power (4%)"

US, UK, China, Russians.. historically they pumped the most carbon
into atmo, so they are responsible for global warming.

Any green tech invented in these countries need to be shared with the
rest of the world due to this offense. US polluted over 30 TIMES more
compared to Indonesia. Top 10 polluters are responsible for 70% of
historical carbon pollution.

"Brett McGurk .. senior [ME] policy official..  traveled to Baghdad
last week [May 2021] to speak with Iraqi prime minister ..  about...
the future of U.S. troops [in Iraq]. As of today, there are roughly
2,500 U.S. troops deployed to Iraq — down from nearly 6,000 in 2016.

In reality, however, the U.S. military is spending about as much
time ducking rocket fire from an alphabet soup of Shia militias. The
attacks on Iraqi military bases and airports that house U.S. personnel
or contractors have gotten so frequent that a week free of rocket fire
is almost considered an abnormality.

According to a count by the AFP news agency, around 30 rocket, mortar,
or bomb attacks on U.S.-linked facilities and coalition troop convoys
have occurred since President Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
