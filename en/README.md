"[A Penn State] team integrated water purification technology into a
new proof-of-concept design for a sea water electrolyzer ..
[Researcher states: 'T]he holy grail of producing hydrogen would be to
combine the sea water and the wind and solar energy found in coastal
and offshore environments'.

Despite the abundance of sea water, it is not commonly used for water
splitting. Unless the water is desalinated prior to entering the
electrolyzer — an expensive extra step — the chloride ions in sea
water turn into toxic chlorine gas, which degrades the equipment and
seeps into the environment.

To prevent this, the researchers inserted a thin, semipermeable
membrane, originally developed for purifying water in the reverse
osmosis (RO) treatment process. The RO membrane replaced the
ion-exchange membrane commonly used in electrolyzers"

Proposal -- ingredient capitalism. Supplies only the basic
ingredients, no end products. The end-products are increasingly harder
to customize anyway, the needs are too varied.

I've seen ppl use coconut oil for sticks even. But spray is better IMO.

Trying now. Fine so far... These essent oils are dense as fuck. Tee
tree? Dam

Baking soda + water + essent. oil? That easy?

While we r at it, why not deodorant? These f-ing corporations load
their deo with alimunium, prevents sweating, not healthy. Neutralize.

Plus u can use the best flour for [own metabolism](2012/04/btype-table-md.html).
Funky doesn't always mean healthy, e.g. rye is not good for all , neither is
"whole wheat".

DIY bread; flour, add yeast, wait. Throw in cooker over cooking paper,
done. One less shopping item.

Muad'dib.. Mohammad.. They sound kind of the same no? *Dune* also takes
place in a desert? Got this all figured out.

Oh yea.. `pyradio` allows manual addition of radio stations with
`pyradio -a`. Added a lower bitrate station. Stickler for low bitrate.

Seriously.. They'll ask anything on the Internet. They also don't know

"[The Internet Computer solution] Dfinity’s valuation soars to $9.5Bn
after revealing its governance system and token economics....  The NNS
now means the [IC] is feature complete. It represents a seminal moment
in the history of the internet. For the first time, internet services
will be governed in a completely independent, decentralized manner. It
is the technical solution to the systemic problems Big Tech has
created with its monopoly over the internet, a public utility that
should be completely open — bringing back the concept of the
programmable web. The NNS is the catalyst for the open internet we
were promised in the 1990s, and it ensures that the future of the
internet remains open and free.'"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
