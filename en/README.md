Manchin won't be the party pooper then?

"@sahilkapur

Important policy news this weekend: @Sen_JoeManchin went [on TV] and
kept the door open to higher stimulus checks up to 2,000 (he prefers
they be targeted but didn't draw a red line) and called for spending
as much as $4 trillion (!) on infrastructure"

That black hole fail was the last straw .. Just the fact that two
reputable scientists debunking the crap out of a concept so widely
accepted is proof enough.

Mainstream sci today looks more and more like Church teachings from
the Middle Ages.

Church teachings are bunk, bunch of alternate theoreticians roam
about, most of whom are also quacks.

No wonder art, cinema is obsessed with the era.

Its probably safe to ignore any mainstream physics since 30s. Same for
base math pretty much. If 19th century math was good enough for
Feynman it's good enough for me.

the dollar falling"

The entire world is rushing, competing to sell to US, as well as to

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
