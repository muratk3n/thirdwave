Garcetti is seeking to budget 24 million for a 'guaranteed basic
income' pilot program providing $1,000/month to 2,000 households for a
year, 'no questions asked, wherever poverty lives in our city.'"

H2 from thin air.. Also (perhaps more important), a better way for
electrolysis (boil water, get the vapor, this process will electrolyze
it better)

"Mihalis Tsampas['s group] worked on a method to split water in its
vapor phase, which occurs much more frequently than its liquid
phase. Working with gas instead of liquid has several advantages
explains Tsampas. There are a few technical problems with liquids,
such as undesired bubbles, also there is no need for expensive
installations to purify the water by using water in the gaseous phase
instead of the liquid phase. And finally by using the water that is
present in the surrounding air, their technology can also be used in
remote places where no water is available"

They can still go ahead and break away, EU will welcome that.. Catalan
situation went awry bcz of the power-setup rather than legalese.. The
EU did not back Catalonia's independence.. They would however
*wholeheartedly* back a Scottish independence.

"UK PM has to grant permission for a [Scottish] referendum but [PM]
has made it clear he has no intention of doing this. Whether the
Scottish parliament has the legal right to organise a referendum
without Westminster's permission is a question that has never been
tested in court. One option may be to just go ahead anyway to try to
hold a referendum, and so then what? Then you may be into a situation
that Catalonia found itself in where it pushed ahead with a referendum
that was not seen to be within the legal order of the Spanish
Constitution"

‘It’s not sport if you can’t lose’: Guardiola criticises Man City’s
Super League plan

"@ds_wats0n

Not gonna pretend I know or care much about football (AKA soccer, dear
American friends) but this #SuperLeague nonsense is straight
bonkers. Late capitalism at its catastrophic"

The best part of the plan was "3 additional teams will be allowed to
play in it *based on their domestic performance*". It's like yeaaa
will give you some crums too, dont you worry.. WTF?

A dozen or so famous football (the game where u kick the ball around
with your foot) teams headed by billionaires want to break away and
form their own close circuit league. The move smacks of
"royalty".. these 'founding' teams wont be competing in champion's
league anymore, for which they have to win every year in their
domestic leagues, but they would auto-qualify for this "super" league
and always compete against eachother/. Summary from It's a bad
idea. Not surprisingly almost everyone with a stake in the game seems
to be against it.

These billionaires.. so removed from things around them 
 
"How about the European Super League plans?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
