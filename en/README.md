Wanna be outdoors, be outdoors. Hike, camp whatever. Be outdoors like
like a forager, the way we've lived for half a million years.

"But I want to be outdoors, work the land"

Since the approach is well contained and controlled, I bet it can be
fully automated one day.. Load up seeds from one end, come back in two
months to get your fully grown beans from the other end..

VF approach uses artificial light, artificial soil, utilizes less
water, it is a completely contained environment can be easier to
protect against chaotic weather, harmful instects (less need for
pesticides, another bonus).

"Vertical or indoor farming is increasingly heralded as the future of
modern agriculture... These companies have been able to raise millions
of dollars to expand their current facilities and establish new
ones...

Fundamental to the creation of a perfect indoor farming environment
for both small and large operations is the availability of affordable,
sophisticated lighting technologies. In fact, there are many different
types of grow lights... 

In its simplest definition, a grow light is an artificial source of
light, commonly an electric light, which is designed to stimulate the
growth of plants by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum perfect for
photosynthesis"

"Vertical farming is the practice of producing food on vertically
inclined surfaces. Instead of farming vegetables and other foods on a
single level, such as in a field or a greenhouse, this method produces
foods in vertically stacked layers commonly integrated into other
structures like a skyscraper, shipping container or repurposed
warehouse...

Instead of soil, aeroponic, aquaponic or hydroponic growing mediums
are used. Peat moss or coconut husks and similar non-soil mediums are
very common in vertical farming. Finally, the vertical farming method
uses various sustainability features to offset the energy cost of
farming. In fact, vertical farming uses 95% less water"

Our focus is fundamental tech, not trinkets.

Toiling away on a piece of land, throwing bunch of shit on the soil,
(pesticides etc seeping into the soil). Isnt this incredibly outdated?
Technology should transform this field..

"@PaulEremenko

Thoughtful piece from @timhepher at @Reuters captures key issue..
@Universal_H2 can decarbonize regional aviation in the 2020s--no
problem. The big challenge is to de-risk hydrogen for @Boeing &
@Airbus to make 737 & A320 successor in 2030s zero-emissions!"
Otherwise there's no way for aviation to meet Paris Agreement
targets. Synfuels and biofuels are a partial carbon offset scheme that
doesn't get us to the 1.5Â°C emissions trajectory. There just isn't
another way!

Reuters: "Universal Hydrogen, a U.S.-based firm planning to provide
hydrogen propulsion for regional aircraft, said on Thursday it would
accelerate development after raising $20.5 million in funds amid a
debate over carbon-free aviation"

On Wirecard fin troubles and Germany.. some of the self-flagellation is

Cld insert all recent GDELT data files into a lite SQL DB, then
anytime something happens to a country can go back in time and find
all actions that was done to that country until that event, diplo
warnings, attacks, etc. look at the source groups and try to see
patterns.. \#ifIHadTheTime

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
