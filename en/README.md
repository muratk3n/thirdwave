Fast digital payments are a good thing of course. But curr, money base
needs the ability to expand.

This is why left-leaning econs hate this thing to a man.

Hal Finney's (so called "Satoshi") reasoning for creating BTC was
wrong. He created it in the aftermath of 2008 crisis (his pseudo is
taken after his neighbor's name who lost money during crisis), and
thought "printing money" was the culprit. The problem wasnt printing
money per se, but who you print it for.

BTC is absolutely the expression of the naivete of the common tech
dipshit - bright, shiny object-ist, unaware of landscape, soc
ecosystem, side effects, etc..

In the absence of clear-cut scientific law, differing views surface,
and among enough knowledgable people, their average leads to something
optimal-ish. Example in econ there is divisions around thriftyness and
extra spending (some research popping up on the question but nothing
solid). Bitcoin though just chooses one side of that argument,
ignoring the other (money base cannot expand = thrift) hence it takes
itself out of the discussion altogether.

What kind of notation is that? If random, not-referenced-elsewhere
Greek letter is used, you have to assume summation over all indices?
$u_\beta$ means $u_x + u_y + u_z$? WTF? What the actual f--k man?

News: I'm told that as the budget reconciliation process is expected
to get underway in Congress soon, a top progressive network,
@PplsAction, is crafting its own list of priorities: -Recurring cash
payments -Expanded eviction moratorium -Vaccines for all -State
funding"

Practitioners in these fields like proposing such things though, it
makes the sound smart. Hell one is thinking abt multiple
universes.. isnt that smart? Sadly no.. I gurantee it these ppl are
extremely bleeping dumb.

---

Fundam phy is stuck, and they know it. But they think they need more
elaborate ideas to get out of it, enter endless "thought experiments"
on time, universes, determinism, etc. But it is very possible what
they missed is something basic, but two or three steps ago. They built
up all this shit thinking that step was real, so the fix will involve
fixing that error, or creating something more fundamental than having
these "sexy tricks" to get out.

Started to watch more cable news, this must be return to some kind of normal

wow wonder why VCs and tech execs want no taxes on capital gains, an
expanded market for equities, and short sellers banned and/or jailed"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
