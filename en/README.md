"Chris Christie ... issued a mea culpa last week after he was
discharged from a COVID-19 hospitalization that included a week in the
intensive-care unit. 'When you get this disease, it hits you how easy
it is to prevent,' he wrote under the headline 'I Should Have Worn a
Mask' in The Wall Street Journal. 'We are asked to wear cloth over our
mouth and nose, wash our hands and avoid crowds. Seldom has so little
been asked for so much benefit'"

ðŸ¤£ These tech characters are so jaded.. The smartest ones will say
what they don't know, most others believe they can extend their
gibberish-ist technobabble into a complete new domain where they zero

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
