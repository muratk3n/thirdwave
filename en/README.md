US, on [transistor patents](2020/03/appelbaum.md#transistor). 1952..
Truman's time.

I guess carbon storage can be a pain in the ass...

Ideally though u want some cheap crystallization tech anyone can use
which once solidified 1 throws solid CO2 in a pit nearby where they
wont mix with, pollute anything.

They provide a carbon storage service? In Norway? Sounds like a good idea.

"Northern Lights project: a collaboration between Equinor, Shell and
Total that is paving the way for a shared European infrastructure for
carbon transport and storage"

I didnt mean Biden admin does not want to help in that unity
post. Just saying the word reminds me some stuff and here they are. Im
some f-ing guy on the Internet, under no obligation to follow "the
cycle". Dont read this shit.

I am in research, ed material seeking mode which is always intense.

Loud I mean loud, one dude was like "Im at home, shut the doors,
windows, still frickin Lars Ulrich is banging the drums in my head".

It is rare but there are left leaning rich people, like Hanauer..
keeps saying if nothing is done the pitchforks are coming.

---

I could profile sure.. but than its TMI

It is interesting Benioff had that anti-capitalist rant on the WEF
video.  Genuine or a little "i-am-the-outsider", "my-hippie-inside"
exercise?

I heard he hired Metallica once for some Salesforce company concert
and had them rock so loud ppl had their eardrums pop in central
SF. Middle finger to everyone in SF maybe.

I know nothing else abt this man, will not speculate further.

I am always interested in a book that has ".. and Beyond" in its
title, no matter the topic.

Too much short interest on that stock, 140% on float is
ludicrous. Someone jumped the shark one that one, waiting to get
smacked. 

"@ihors3

GME short [interest] is $10.64B ... 139.73%"

Arithmetic degrees are different obviously, East is 0, increases
counter-clockwise.

And the angles increases clockwise ðŸ¤¨

Meteorology has its angles all weird... Pointing directly south is 0
degrees.. I guess they are mainly concerned with "will I be feeling
that cold breeze up my ass, and at what angle?".

From US DOE. Already working, proven tech. 

"Approximately 1,600 miles of hydrogen pipelines are currently
operating in the United States. Owned by merchant hydrogen producers,
these pipelines are located where large hydrogen users, such as
petroleum refineries and chemical plants, are concentrated such as the
Gulf Coast region. Transporting gaseous hydrogen via existing
pipelines is a low-cost option for delivering large volumes of
hydrogen"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
