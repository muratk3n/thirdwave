Oliver Consa: "Something is rotten in the state of [Quantum
Electrodynamics. QED] is considered the most accurate theory in the
history of science. However, this precision is based on a single
experimental value: the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
(g-factor). An examination of QED history reveals that this value was
obtained using illegitimate mathematical traps, manipulations and
tricks" via @unzicker_a

The energy requirements of a zombie makes no sense.. these fuckers are
constantly on the move, dont really "eat" anything, or ppl even just
turn them, where do they get the energy? If they truly lived on an
energy input, then you'd see mellowed out mfkers wout it, there'd be
these slow moving zombies..

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
