Out of curiosity I dug into how NFT's actually reference the media
you're "buying" and my eyebrows are now orbiting the moon

Short version:

The NFT token you bought either points to a URL on the internet, or an
IPFS hash. In most circumstances it references an IPFS gateway on the
internet run by the startup you bought the NFT from"

More teachers.. better teachers..? When horse carrieges gave way to
cars, 'better' or 'more' horses talk became moot.

US support for China since the 70s might have another logic in it ðŸ¤”
besides containing Russia. Lets say u are US, and want to be included
in a region. Which country would you support in that region?  Answer:
the one that is surrounded by 19 countries who are hostile to it. Then
once that country gets stronger, everyone in the region will freak
out, and call the superpower for help (as they should). 

CH doesnt have to play this game. Work on yiour pluralism,
democracy.

Beckley: "China may have the worldâ€™s biggest economy and military, but
it also leads the world in debt; resource consumption; pollution;
useless infrastructure and wasted industrial capacity; scientific
fraud; internal security spending; border disputes... China also uses
seven times the input to generate a given level of economic output as
the United States and is surrounded by nineteen countries, most of
which are hostile toward China, politically unstable, or both"

"Oh but there is a formula for vaccs?" Same for Coca-Cola. Arent there
urban legends around that? "Bro it's sooo secret, it is kept at
[insert weird vault locale]"

Vaccine shortages in so many countries. Unbelievable..

Coca-Cola can shit out its shit product to the tune of 1 billion A
DAY, but we cant make potentially life saving drug for everyone fast
enough? And this is after *a year* has passed. Good to see capitalism
has its priorities straight.. Sugared water vs life saving
drug. Mmmm... "I'll go with sugared water".

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
