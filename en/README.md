These ppl cant seem to catch a break. 

Clinton restored that guy to power BTW in 1994 (backed up by UN Sec
Council decision -US mil deployed, dictators fleed wout fight-) but in
the long run did the intervention help?  H has much intervention,
there seems to be a repetition set in around that particular
dysfunction.

Signals are increasingly distorted

"@aaronclauset

Increasingly, I dislike hearing 'Congratulations!' when someone says a
paper got into a fancy venue. It sounds nice! But to me, it
compliments the 'winning' (metadata) rather than the science
(content), and furthers the gamification of science"

Another pollution related scandal in Germany? Unbelievable. Of course
Volkswagen is also involved.

"According to a story in Forbes this week, the fact that German
authorities have been looking into the auto industry’s business
dealing has caused industry leaders to engage in a mad-dash to be the
first whistleblower... Indeed, it looks like Daimler grabbed the
golden ring, which could save it billions, while Volkswagen, which
thought it had won the honors, came in second and BMW is a distant
third. Under European Union law, the first one to become a
whistleblower usually comes away with little more than a slap on the
wrist .. while number three pays the bulk, in this case, BMW"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
