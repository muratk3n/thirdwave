I bet it's possible to derive some kind of law using basic chemistry
that anything that can pack high amt of energy has to be, at that
point a simple-molecular fuel. As in basic chemistry would dictate
that.. 

---

This was all volumetric energy levels, did not even look at weight
issues yet. They will likely be as bad as Li-On. 

---

Solid-State batteries.. Let's check them out.

Current Li-On bats have 1.8 MJ/liter. It is estimated that their dev
will stagnate at around 2.88 MJ/liter. Solid state, the hot-shot tech
will give you 3.6 MJ / liter. :(

Not even around yet BTW until 2030 and their prod issues have not been
resolved.

Air travel not possible w that kind of density.

Liquified H2 has 8.5 MJ/liter, the soln Airbus is considering. 

"The best-in-class of these [Li-on] cells have an energy density of
around 700 watt-hours per liter (Wh/l)...  Yet, their energy density
is expected to stagnate at around 800 Wh/l due to the characteristics
of their active materials .. 1000 Wh/l should become available in
2030—in the form of solid-state lithium-metal batteries. "

These black holes, freaking time dilation fields, new models arnd huge
cosmological events are pure speculation. In *Sunshine* the heroes of
the movie managed to fix the sun. Think about that. THE SUN. We were
that adv on that front, see.. But we dont even know what the muck it
is made of.. How cld we fix that shit?

Why is the Big Bang not scifi worthy? It's all fi, not much sci. When
Arthur C. Clarke thought up satellite technology, it was fiction but
scientifically solid. A little more basic science, some more
engineering got us there. Or when Jules Verne thought about using H2
as fuel in 1800s..

Then do we need all that horizontal space to grow stuff on? Have this
"liquid soil", have all vertically stacked up, grow stuff

Alternatives to soil for farming

"[P]lants are grown in a liquid solution of water and
nutrients. Hydroponics agriculture is performed within greenhouses
that have temperature regulations that allow crops to be grown
year-round"

He also answered the question "what is fascism?" with "it is
whatever's going through my head at that point in time". 

---

Haha.. of course. Makes perfect sense.

"Benito Mussolini coined the term 'fascism' in 1919 to describe his
political movement. He adopted the ancient Roman fasces as his
symbol. This was a bundle of rods tied around an ax, which represented
the power of Rome"

US may not have *köfte*, but it does have meatloaf. Pretty much the
same ingredients.. very tasty too.. With that whole
glaze.. yiiieeaaeah...

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
