Why are GPUs (as oppose to CPUs) so popular? They bring you
parallelism on the cheap... It is getting harder to have single CPUs
to go faster, but running things in parallel, w cheap GPUs (with many
"cores") is possible -- first blogged [here](2014/12/q-1012.md). An
entry-level NVidia GTX 1050 GPU has 640 cores. Insane.

Well that's good.. current state is somewhat embarrasing..

"@ArthurDelaneyHP

I interviewed a career bartender in Palm Springs, Calif. whose job
just can't exist with a plague going crazy.

Lawmakers collectively understood that in March, but not now.

'I was making $80,000 a year and living comfortably and now I’m
waiting in food lines,' he said"

Always psyched to learn different modes of parallelization. Dabbled in
a few so far, in-proc threads with in-mem data, multi process with DB,
and map/reduce. The one I am looking at is new, at least in the
close-to-the-metal way of coding it..

Could even be better on the eyes.. Eye sees light, then makes sense
for the thing we actively try to distinquish to *have* light -- the letters.

Lots of options for people who like inverted colors on their

that is actively catered to... nice.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
