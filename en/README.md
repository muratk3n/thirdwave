M. Mikkelsen movie, *Polar*, thumbs up. J Wick type story, but it
stands on its own. Rated R.

Great scenery, new moral dilemmas, space and Earth - The Expanse did
not disappoint \#S0508

OoooOOOo Java Applet, is it?

Of course the URL is now pointing to hyperspace.. 404.

That's some old shit right there.

The parts that make up these Frankensteins are also broken beyond
repair, e.g. TR nationalism is bizarrely fallacious. The locals of
Anatolia owe next to nothing to "the steppes", neither in genetics,
nor in culture (every migrants was assimilated into the region, and
the gov culture was Roman -so again local-). How my people manage to
move an inch is beyond me, but then again, they really aren't.

Which and how the ideological parts get included can be completely
arbitrary, the mix is all in the mind of the fascist.

The leaders of these parties, coalitions are effective schizophrenics,
mental patients of DID (dissociative identity disorder). This is not
surprising bcz the poor asshole has to maintain all that crud in a
singular head. So one day he'll talk about his "pure race from the
steppes of Central Asia", the next socialism-level state intervention,
the one after that neoliberal market action. The followers clap
nevertheless, too braindead to realize something is off, but sadly for
the country, its media also suffer from the same condition who
mistake this show for politics.

TR lives in a seperate plane of existence, as such naturally shows how
not to do something, anything.. Its parties, coalitions are cesspools
of proto-fascim, bunch of stuff thrown in some container *beforehand*,
from get-go, either after coups, or in "parties" that live in the
aftermath of those coups. Take 4 views, throw them in, done. Of course
it is impossible to maintain incompatibilities for an extended period
of time, that's where fascism comes in.

A by-product of the approach is whatever the mix happens to be,
anything that is left out, is immediately deligitimized. This can be
the left, sometimes the right (and almost always Kurds), but there is
always the legitimate mix and "others".

"How do things work in TR?"

If party gets its chance to govern on his own, great. See FDR and the
New Deal.

FDR knew what he wanted. He nearly packed the SC for its
hand-wringing.

Yes I said thought leaders, not random jagoff out on the street, see
below. She is asking what was done for them, not "have you checked the
latest polls?"

"If u can keep it" is part retort

The emergent, self-organized blocks of ideologies, as clusters, carry
within a good signal, if enough though leaders coalesced around
something, chances are there is an approach that needs representing.

---

Do coalitions.. But between ideologically distinct parties. If that is
in place, fine, obviously some coalitions will be able to deliver more
than others, but at least seperate parties decide how that coalition
is formed, on their own terms.

"If not unifying, then should people not do coalitions?"

---

Modernity = Industrial System = Second Wave. It is about
standardization, centralization, maximization, etc which forms the
superstructure, but underneath that some countries managed to supplant
it with a proper representative democracy. Not suprisingly they are
better off than others.

---

Yes but the best way to do it is through democracy.

"Can you do modernity without democracy?"

---

Larry King was a good interviewer, but lost the touch near the end
there..

That quick, unbalancing question will work if 1 knows the
landscape. Use it on Seinfeld, u get your ass handed to you. Saw him
faceplant like that few more times too.

"Putin.. He puts it in. So he's like Clinton!". üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ

Whose joke was that? It was good

OpenWeatherMap üëç. They nailed that prediction 4 days into
the future. Wind, rain, all there.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
