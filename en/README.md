Police officers are holding them steps away from the Senate chamber,

"@sambrodey

McConnell: 'The Constitution gives us here in Congress a limited
role. We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections
on steroids'"

The $2000 check discussion ended up helping Dems IMO... They came
across as more for it (w Biden 4 from the start, Bernie as its main
defender), the party w WH and Senate cld not deliver. People dont know
much, but they understand the difference between 'have money' and
'have no money'.

Better off fighting off the high Ph of Venus atmo, or build a Stanford
Torus than doing all that monkey shit. Plus even if atmo was solvable,
low grav is not, long-term, ur bones will still melt

Dude "creating a magnetic field with a satellite, strategically placed
to create magnetic field so Mars can keep an atmosphere?" MILLIONS IN
YOUR COUNTRY DO NOT HAVE HEALTHCARE.

When I was a kid for a while I was obsessed with knife and axe

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
