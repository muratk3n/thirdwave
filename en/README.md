Forbes: "Hyzon, A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Truck Maker, In SPAC Deal Valued At $2.6 Billion"

"Hydrogen pumping stations are all over California and could be in the
Denver metro area by the end of this year. "

I like the title, "The H-Factor"

---

"In a grand, clean energy strategy published in mid-December, a brain
trust of cross-sector Canadian savants predicted that hydrogen-powered
locomotion—already nicknamed “hydrail”—would be ready for testing some
time about 2025, first in the form of yard switchers, short-leashed to
their refueling stations.

The very next day, Dec. 18, Canadian Pacific (CP) smashed that
timeline, and woke the North American rail industry"

Some early Zack Snyder buzz, on the Justice League recut (?) (soon to
be released). In trailer has a character say "we live in a society",
ppl loving it online. Apparently meme based on

.. then became a Joker thing, now Zack had it voiced in movie.

It's good.. keeping the fans happy. I hope new JL pans out.

Average surface elevation of Earth is 840 meters... most know "sea
level" is not actually zero elevation level.. The real bottom is at
the bottom of some the sea, ocean.. And there is a lota ocean!

We all live on mountain tops IOW

Landau wrote some fantastic books. 

Landau: "There can be little argument that computation has become an
essential element in all areas of physics, be it via simulation,
symbolic manipulations, data manipulations, equipment interfacing, or
something with which we are not yet familiar. Nevertheless, even
though the style of teaching and organization of subjects being taught
by physics departments have changed in recent times, the actual
content of the courses has been slow to incorporate the new-found
importance of computation. Yes, there are now speciality courses and
many textbooks in Computational Physics, but that is not the same
thing as incorporating computation into the very heart of a modern
physics curriculum so that the physics being taught today more closely
resembles the physics being done today"

Creator is [more likely](2015/04/god.md)

"Which is likely? Creator or not?"

---

By turning something into a process, we dont automatically remove "an
omnipotent creator" from the picture. Everyone likes the invention of
evolution. "God did not create the final thing, it was an evolutionary
process". Boom. Darwin is world famous.

"Well now let's apply that to the universe".. thought some perhaps,
"God did not make it happen, it started from a small seed, turned into
everything we see"

Except the creator isnt exactly removed from the picture, ie the most
enthusiastic supporters of Big Bang were and are[ the Clergy. that one
one focused, 'big' creational event must have jelled more with their
view of the creator.

But get this; an omnipo being can bring stuff into existence, close to
what they are now, just as easily as some magic process that will
evolve into as they are now. Dont want to assume either way, what I am
saying is opting for long-running process just to remove the Big Guy
is not necessarily more scientific.

"Budweiser ordered 800 hydrogen-fueled heavy delivery trucks and
is using some in California, the national leader in building out a
subsidized network of refueling stations and creating incentives for
vehicle purchases [in 2019]"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
