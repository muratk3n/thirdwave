Trump is obsessed with them too (another IaC). Polls, ratings, right, we know this

Clinton is an *I Am CRM*, their area of development is listening more,
so he probably instinctively used polls to push himself in that
direction, to offset his lack of skill. You cant make a rule out of a
few people's shortcomings.

"Clinton polled all the time"

I understand the skepticism. But the shit is (mostly) real this
time. There is a newfound urgency.

Hah. I guess there is an "example nation" that every mother uses for
their children to urge them to finish their plates. Apparently it was
"starving Ethiopoans" in US recently (says the interviewee), but
before that, it was "starving Armenians". That's the one Peterson
heard growing up, and one day becomes curious where it came from,
decides to research it, and ends up writing another book this time on
the infamous "alleged" terrible events, and US' response to it.

Party leaders must make this decision, seeing it will be in their
interest in the long term. People's thoughts on the issue is
irrelevant. But they can be sold a palette of choices with the right
leader.

---

Leftist ideas were orphaned due to years of mainstream neglect. But
there was a price to pay for this, ordinary people's living standards
fell. Surprisingly the mainstream kept ignoring "the fringe", so
finally, some in the right adopted some of those ideas. This is Trump,
and others, some calling themselves in weird names not to offend the
*nomenklatura*. The intention was to help, should be congratulated
even though it is not sustainable IMO. Left / Right mix is toxic, you
are either one side or the other. So one party must adapt this shit --
otherwise the balance is lost.

hotspot, then each machine has an IP address, and can see eachother on

Replaced Termux with Juice SSH everything else the same. Final setup;
Bluetooth keyb (light) on Android (light), SSH over RPi (very light),
run everything on board. Files to/fro done through passwordless ssh
(scp) if required. Total weight, size, negligable.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
