I am convinced caffeine is good for you. Drink that shit. Chuck it!

While on the subj in 2019 ~200 million tons of coal was
exported.

Clean alternative, burn, CCS, ship ammonia.

Looks like CH lost their shit... they are flailing about, incenced
wout reason.. This business w AU was completely avoidable.

"[Reports say] China was restricting imports of coal only from
Australia and prioritising imports from Mongolia, Indonesia and
Russia"

Panels in the Arctic Circle (north)..? Sure. 6 months of constant-daylight.

When dark, no problem, panels in the Antartic Circle (south). Go for
it.

---

Since we r not tied to below-ground resources, countries with sea
access near the equator cld create floating panel structures.

How much solar panel space would Saudi Arabia need to produce its
crude output's equiv energy,

Production is 9.01 million barrels / day (Nov 2020).

1 Barrel of oil is 136 kg. Energy density of crude oil 158.4 Kwh/kg.

Sun energy falling on Earth 1 kW/m2, 24 KWh/m2 in a day.

Panel efficiency 20%, sunlight availability 50% (highest for SA)

```python
solar_kwh_day_m2 = 24*0.20*0.50
oil_energy_day = 136 * 9.01 * 1e6 * 158.4
area = (oil_energy_day / solar_kwh_day_m2)
print ("area of %0.2f km^2" % (area / 1e6))
print ("square with one side %0.2f km" % (np.sqrt(area) / 1000.0))
```

```text
area of 80873.76 km^2
square with one side 284.38 km
```

An area 290 km x 290 km. of panels. SA Rub' al Khali desert is 650,000
km^2, 1/7th of that is needed approximately. It's not a small area,
sure, but not insane large, like Texas? If we are desparate, we might
see some unorthodox engineering.

That wld be the "The Great Leap Forward" and the Cultural Rev I

"[T]wo-thirds of Hong Kong's population fled revolution, famine and
poverty in mainland China, mostly during the 1950s and 1960s"

Professionally as well whichever country made your career gets the
credit. Do grad deg in US, work there, you are their success story homes.

So there is not much "brain drain" as is usually known, there is "raw
brain material drain", where raw parts move from country to country
that get formed into a brain elsewhere.

Crazy. Elements of that concl must be stewing in head for >20 yrs. I
remember how Ozdemir writes he knows so many local (DE) stories, tales
intimately and knows no other ones from anywhere else in similar fashion.

---

In fact Cem Özdemir, the first parliementarian of "TR origin" in DE
partliament, wrote a book about precisely that, titled *Ich bin
Inländer* (I am Native). I read it during the 90s. This book was one
of many data points that contributed to this blog's
raised-in-country-is-culture conclusion rather than
assumed-or-given-identity-is-culture delusion.

He is a German of TR origin..

He went there at a very young age, and what does [culture code](2014/06/the-culture-code.md)
say?  He is a product of their culture, schools, etc.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
