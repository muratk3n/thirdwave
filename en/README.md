NYT: "Coronavirus Origins Remain Unclear in W.H.O.-China Inquiry"

"Pfizer has been accused of 'bullying' Latin American governments in
Covid vaccine negotiations and has asked some countries to put up
sovereign assets, such as embassy buildings and military bases, as a
guarantee against the cost of any future legal cases, the Bureau of
Investigative Journalism can reveal.

In the case of one country, demands made by the pharmaceutical giant
led to a three-month delay in a vaccine deal being agreed. For
Argentina and Brazil, no national deals were agreed at all. Any
hold-up in countries receiving vaccines means more people contracting
Covid-19 and potentially dying"

So much discussion around the UK's Indo-Pacific tilt misses the point
that the UK is also part of a wider European tilt to the region
(rather than indulging in some sort of neo-colonial nostalgia trip)"

"We shouldn’t have had to go to court. For a year, we’ve been fighting
legal battles over the British government’s secretive NHS data deals
with controversial ‘spy tech’ firm Palantir.

Today, we can announce an important victory.

Back in December, after we had spent months on legal efforts to get
transparency, the government snuck through a massive £23m, two-year
deal with Palantir, a CIA-backed data firm. They contracted Palantir
to process our sensitive health data.

We raised objections: the initial deals were framed as a short-term,
emergency COVID response, but the new contract revealed mission creep
well beyond the pandemic.

Government lawyers insisted that citizens have no right to a say in
major NHS contracts with big tech. But we believed the
public does have those rights. So we sued.

Facing our lawsuit, the government has finally caved"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
