Info on Bohmian Mech by S. Hossenfelder. Smolin doesn't like BM bcz
"pilot wave theory fails to satisfy another of our principles:
Einstein’s principle of reciprocity. The pilot wave guides the
particle, but the particle has no effect back on the wave". *Einstein's
Unfinished Revolution*.

Not surprising, Italian fascists built the social security system of
the country.

There is no "left populism", or "right populism". A grab bag of issues
stolen from right and left held together by media trickery or
authoritarinism does not deserve its own lexicon. Most of the time it
is simply fascism-lite. That's it.

"In many West European countries, traditional right wing parties are
challenged by a ‘populist right wing’ discourse which also started to
argue for redistributive welfare policies"

not about $CH_4 += 2O_2 \to 2H_2 O + CO_2$,

nam sayin?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
