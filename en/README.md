To sum, the mere existence of these types means *less* for the rest.

Acemoglu: "In this paper we develop a new perspective on the
establishment of the monopoly of violence and the formation of the
state. We build a model to explain the incentive of central states to
eliminate non-state armed actors (paramilitaries) in a
democracy... Since paramilitaries naturally have preferences over
policies, when they choose to become involved in politics, this may
reduce the incentives of the politicians they favor to eliminate
them. The model predicts that in non- paramilitary areas policies are
targeted to citizens while in paramilitary areas they cater to the
preferences of paramilitaries. This implies that in paramilitary areas
citizens obtain fewer public goods"

Colombia's ministry of defense says some of those detained for the
killing of Haitian president are former soldiers. Colombian

Americans"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
