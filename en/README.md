lawsuit asking to block certification of the vote in Georgia, in what
an Assistant AG called a bid to roll back the clock to Jim Crow"

You gotta fill in the blanks, nam sayin? Do the deed. Dot the i's. Do
the work ordinary Americans do not want to do (and cant f--ing do,
lets be honest).

"2011 social protests and the fall of holding group tycoons. After mass
demonstrations in 2011 that brought hundreds of thousands of Israelis
onto the streets countrywide — it was estimated at the time that the
ten biggest business groups controlled 41 percent of the market value
of public companies — the Knesset passed the Law for Promotion of
Competition and Reduction of Concentration in 2013"

"2011 Israeli social justice protests ... [let to r]evelations of
funding from specific left-wing individuals and organizations like
S. Daniel Abraham and the New Israel Fund. Maariv journalist Kalman
Libeskind claimed that the spontaneous protests had actually been
three months in the planning by Stan Greenberg and orchestrated by
left-wing organizations and the National Left"

I thought more capitalism would get you better service, it was a
"no-brainer".

Dayen, *Monopolized*: "In 2014, Jet Blue decided it would zig while
the industry zagged. CEO David Barger declared that his company would
be the quality airline, with roomy, comfortable seating, free checked
bags, and fast Wi-Fi. For Barger, the announcement aligned JetBlue
with its founding principles: he had been there from the beginning,
helping design the company’s 'service-oriented' culture. 'I think you
can be profitable without gouging the traveling public,' Barger told a
local paper.

But stock analysts hated the idea. They beat up Barger for being
'overly concerned' with customers rather than shareholder returns. And
they eventually ran him out of town. Two months after Barger stepped
down, JetBlue rolled back the legroom and raised fees on baggage and
Wi-Fi. Analysts parceled out the 'improvements' to the penny. Charging
a baggage check fee would add 26¢ a share; charging for Wi-Fi would
add another 9¢. Springing fees on customers 'might hurt JetBlue in the
media,' wrote Cowen and Co. analyst Helane Becker in a research note,
but “the revenue benefit to the company would probably trump any
customer push back.”

The episode reflects how, after government deregulation, Wall Street
has taken control of the airline industry and demanded oligopolistic
conformity. Airlines were once seen as financial poison. The world’s
premier investor, Warren Buffett, joked in a 2007 investor letter: 'If
a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have
done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville [Wright] down.'
By the end of 2018, Buffett held roughly 44 million shares in American
Airlines, 65.5 million in Delta, 55 million in Southwest, and 22
million in United, for a total investment of over $10 billion"

Decathlon sells "panchos" but these things are a "chique wilderness"
thing, they dont work well. It's fine, I have my fucking 3 Eur PVC
raincoat now, and am very happy with it.

Bought a raincoat for 3 Eur from a store that sells items to workers
in bulk. Literally a fucking PVC material, single piece, w some
buttons on front, that's it. I could not find a simple fucking
raincoat at the stores that are in shiny malls.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
