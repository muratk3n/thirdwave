So it is Facebook?

"@bradleytusk

The tech giants know this. Someone‚Äôs going down. Their real fight
isn‚Äôt with Congress or the Department of Justice or regulators from
any particular agency. The real fight is to make another company the
more appealing target.

'Zuck, Bezos, Cook: Who takes the fall in D.C.‚Äôs antitrust games? Last
week‚Äôs hearing was more circus than bread, but America‚Äôs tech titans
have reason to worry. Somebody is going down. The only question is
who‚Äîand when'"

Pretty grim news here on the Oxford coronavirus vaccine: 2 of the
8,000 UK participants in the trial have developed a rare illness
involving inflammation of the spine"

Another proof that we are not teaching science, but cargo cult
science.  There are still flat-earthers. We've known Earth is not flat
for over two millenia. Yet the so-called "educated" would be hard
pressed to prove this fact starting from simple assumptions, hence
they cannot prove it to others with convictionn, disinformation
grows. We created a culture of technobabble with little knowledge.

Have to be more media / legal savy... Look at the monkey boy.. The
weasel fuck knows how to play the media and adapt to every
situation. That's how such an inferior tech, as in battery based cars
came so far.

NKLA WTF?

I wonder how much predictive power the neighboring quakes have for
predicting a quake in a particular location ü§î

---

Earthquake data from an API,

```python
from quakefeeds import QuakeFeed
feed = QuakeFeed("4.5", "day")
print (len(feed))
print (feed.event_title(0))
print (feed.event_title(1))
print (feed.event_title(2))
```

```text
8
M 4.5 - 14 km N of Tisco, Peru
M 5.0 - 6 km NNE of Falam, Myanmar
M 4.5 - 248 km N of Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands
```

8 quakes >=4.5 in a day, all around the world.

After the Cal quake checked [this acct](https://mobile.twitter.com/EQAlerts_M4)
for >4.0 eqs. Looks like the whole world is shaking, constantly.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
