People keep asking why Navalny went back to Russia...some have called

The trials and tribulations of Hawley is the perfect example why
fascism-lite, the so-called "populism", is unsustainable as an
ideology. Dude supported the Trump tax, then sided with Bernie on the
$2000 check, is for anti-trust and but then went batshit on election
fraud charges... He is a mess. This cant be the basis of Rep party, or
any party.. These people can only exist as a reaction to something
else.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
