Fantastic news.. makes a lot of sense for Oz.. South Korea, Japan are
already reorienting their econ around renewable fuels, Oz has natural
resources and needs a green way to ship its energy. The buyers will be
ready, waiting to buy the product.. And once H2 is produced at such
scales, why not reorient domestic econ for its use as well?  Slam dunk
on all counts.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
