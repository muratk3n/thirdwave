But this could be blessing in disguise.. Less black talent in
finance..? Fine, right? We should hope for less white, Asian, Latino
talent too.

He is probably right. Sad.

"@NBCNews

Wells Fargo CEO: "While it might sound like an excuse, the unfortunate
reality is that there is a very limited pool of black talent to
recruit from."

Both runners probably need to have the same said software for the

Wonderful. We have commodatized Big Brother.  Now everyone can become one. 

"@MrAndrew

Out running this morning on a new route and a lady runs past
me. Despite only passing, when I get home @Strava automatically tags
her in my run. If I click on her face it shows her full name, picture
and a map of her running route (which effectively shows where she
lives)

This is despite the fact that I don't follow her and she doesn't share
her activity publicly. So basically if someone sees a woman running
alone there's an app they can go to see her name, picture and address"

GI Joe 1 and 2 are two completely different style of movies. They are
different like Speed 1 and 2. Or Zoolander 1 and 2.

"Russian-Turkish talks stalled, worst air raids on Idleb since March"

What a bleeping effin nonsense this Brexit.. People were misled by
those who were supposed to represent them. End it and get rid of those
f-ing fools while you are at it, your "royals". I fear they are a
cultural crutch creating a false sense of queen and country at this
age.

A President can choose his entire cabinet exclusively from Goldman
Sachs, but if the cabinet members are all trans, centrists would be
happy.

"Carbon emissions of richest 1 percent more than double the emissions
of the poorest half of humanity...

Annual emissions grew by 60 percent between 1990 and 2015. The richest
5 percent were responsible for over a third (37 percent) of this
growth. The total increase in emissions of the richest one percent was
three times more than that of the poorest 50 percent"

But of course Jesus' teachings were coopted by the state (Rome),
and turned into another form of pagan worship ritual.

"Jesus Christ was a socialist activist" -- exactly.

Hudson: "The Christianity we know today is not the Christianity of
Jesus.. Indeed the Judaism that we know today is not the Judaism of
Jesus either. Lord’s Prayer, ‘forgive us our sins even as we forgive
all who are indebted to us’, refers specifically to debt.

Most religious leaders say that Christianity is all about sin, not
debt. But actually, the word for sin and debt is the same in almost
every language.

‘Schuld’, in German, means ‘debt’ as well as ‘offense’ or, ‘sin’. It’s
‘devoir’ in French. It had the same duality in meaning in the
Babylonian language of Akkadian.”

The idea harks back to the concept of ‘wergeld’, which existed in
parts of Europe and Babylonia, and set the value of a human life based
on their rank, paid as compensation to the family of someone who has
been injured or killed. he payment – the Schuld or obligation –
expiates you of the injury caused by the offense

People tend to think of the Commandment ‘do not covet your neighbour’s
wife’ in purely sexual terms but actually, the economist says it
refers specifically to creditors who would force the wives and
daughters of debtors into sex slavery as collateral for unpaid debt.

Similarly, the Commandment ‘thou shalt not steal’ refers to usury and
exploitation by threat for debts owing.

Jesus was crucified for his views on debt. Crucifixion being a
punishment reserved especially for political dissidents.

To understand the crucifixion of Jesus is to understand it was his
punishment for his economic views. He was a threat to the creditors.

Jesus Christ was a socialist activist for the continuity of regular
debt jubilees that were considered essential to the wellbeing of
ancient economies

Governments can forgive debt. The bible says so"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
