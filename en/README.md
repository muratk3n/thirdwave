"The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust determined Facebook
wields monopoly powers in social network and has maintained its
position by acquiring, copying or killing its competitors, according
to a report the group released on Tuesday.

The report from the Democratic majority staff, which also addresses
antitrust concerns regarding Amazon, Apple, Google parent-company
Alphabet, recommends that Congress review a series of potential
remedies. This includes “structural separation,” which could require
the companies to split parts of their businesses. For instance,
Facebook could be forced to divest or operationally separate
photo-sharing service Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp, both of
which it acquired"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
