Habit from aero -- '50 kg craft hover requires 50 kg of thrust' u say,
makes it easier to think about it, technically incomplete, but getting
force from mass is easy, $F = ma$ or $F = m g$, $g = 9.8$
approximately, or 10. For force mass of $m = 50 kg$ is multiplied by
10, becomes 500 Newtons.

"You say weight in kilos but talk about push, as in force, kg is not a
force unit"

I'd love to see someone try to make a sub fly. If you see that shit in
a movie don't believe it. It's so heavy... It's like a Boeing with
lithium-ion batteries üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ

---

Now we understand why it is always cramped in a sub.

---

An Ohio class sub weighs 16000 tons. 16K TONS. Typical car weighs < 2,
even a Boeing 737 weighs 71 tons.

---

While it looks fun, a submarine hobby might not be practical. Say I
wanted to have a subsurface living environment, width 2.5, height 3
length 6 meters. This means

```python
w=2.5;h=3;l=6
print (w*h*l, 'm^3')
```

```text
45.0 m^3
```

of volume. 1 cubic meter of water is 1 ton. Then, and bcz when you
submerge something same amount of volume of water in weight pushes
back at you, to counteract it and to remain below surface, you need
provide downward pull of 45 tons! You must artificially *add weight*
to keep this thing below water. People use steel, lead, whatever it
takes to make the structure heavy; this complicates things
logistically in DIY terms, hauling something >20 tons in a truck is a
major pain in the ass. Then u need build on site, or in a navy
yard. We r now talking lots of material, hairy logistics.. government
level stuff.

My interests / skillset are mostly around keeping things light, subs
are a different kinda game.

Armenia is a democracy.

Azerbaijan is so f-ing not, it's actually funny.

Wars between democracies and the rest usually does not go well for the
"the rest".

"The Judiciary Act of 1789 established the first Supreme Court, with
six Justices. In 1801, President John Adams and a lame-duck Federalist
Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which reduced the Court to
five Justices in an attempt to limit incoming President Thomas
Jefferson‚Äôs appointments. Jefferson and his Democratic-Republicans
soon repealed that act, putting the Court back to six Justices. Then,
in 1807, Jefferson and Congress added a seventh Justice when Congress
added a seventh federal court circuit.

In early 1837, President Andrew Jackson was able to add two additional
Justices after Congress expanded the number of federal circuit court
districts. Under different circumstances, Congress created the 10th
Circuit in 1863 during the Civil War, and the Court briefly had 10
Justices. Congress then passed legislation in 1866 to reduce the Court
to seven Justices. That only lasted until 1869, when a new Judiciary
Act sponsored by Senator Lyman Trumbull put the number back to nine
Justices"

Changing the make up of the SCOTUS, not unheard of. FDR nearly packed
the court when they started hand-wringing about the New Deal.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
