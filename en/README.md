Did animation for the system too. It is incredible the amount of
open-source software infra available for this stuff.  All kinds of
shapes are in so-called STL files. Scripting languages can read,
manipulate them. Apply some rudimentary calc and science comes alive.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
