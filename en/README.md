NYT: "Last year, India and South Africa requested a waiver from World
Trade Organization rules governing intellectual property for
technology dealing with the pandemic. Dozens of mostly developing
countries have since joined them. A handful of rich nations, including
the United States, oppose the waiver, but there’s a widespread belief
that if America changes its position, other countries will follow"

2.5b people in Earth's 130 poorest countries have not been
vaccinated... The humanitarian cost is unforgivable - and
self-defeating, as each infected person is a potential source of new
strains...

It was Gates who sabotaged the WHO Covid-19 Technology Access Pool
(C-TAP), replacing it with his failed ACT-Accelerator, a system of
patents and secrecy and vast profits for the pharma industry"

"Biolyse is a small pharmaceutical manufacturer in Canada with a simple
proposition: provide a recipe for a coronavirus vaccine, and it will
produce 20m doses for nations in the global south. It has approached
AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, and even asked the Canadian
government to help it with compulsory licensing – which would give it
the authorisation to produce another company’s patented product for
emergency use – but so far no one has taken up its offer.

When I reached him by phone this week, John Fulton, the vice-president
of Biolyse, told me: 'We’ve been passed over. We’ve got this
production capacity and it’s not being put to use'"

Jacobin: "For the Left, it’s easy to hate the media, with its
entrenched centrist biases and loyalty to the status quo. But a world
without high-quality news is a world where meaningful democracy is
impossible. That’s the message of media scholar Victor Pickard, who
argues for a transformation of our media system away from the model of
commercial news and toward a 'public option'"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
