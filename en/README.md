"Chemical giants DuPont and Daikin knew the dangers of a PFAS compound
widely used in food packaging since 2010, but hid them from the public
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), company studies obtained
by the Guardian reveal.The chemicals ... are now linked to a range of
serious health issues, and Americans are still being exposed to them
in greaseproof pizza boxes, carryout containers, fast-food wrappers,
and paperboard packaging"

Jacobin: "[T]he reality is not all that complicated. Hamas?s rockets
and Palestinians protesting, throwing rocks, or even rioting: these
are all desperate responses to sustained, systematic, and brutal
repression and land theft by Israel that has been going on for
decades, and has sharply escalated over the last decade in
particular. It is the ?language of the unheard,? as Martin Luther King
called the African-American riots of the 1960s, which, like their
counterparts last year and in the decades between, are a similar howl
of frustration from those who have been relentlessly dispossessed and
brutalized with seemingly no recourse.

There are ways of putting an end to such things, whether rocket
attacks or property destruction from rioters. But to do that requires
first accurately describing the injustices that drive them"

Another use of that cool metal hydride solution.. Oz Lavo uses this
tech too..  GKN can store H2 at 40 bars (usually 700 bars is used).

"GKN HY2 Energy System requires 15 times less space compared to
gaseous hydrogen storage systems when holding the same amount of
energy at the same pressure"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
