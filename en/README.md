Tech should allow new ways of working not just extend existing ways of
working.. The Internet at its core is async (send email I dont have to
be constantly looking to 'get' my message, the message just waits for
you).

The Linux OS, one of the largest software projects ever undertaken by
mankind, was mostly developed in this fashion, async, through email,
patch files, shared repos etc.

Do we really need to pose in front of cams to get job done?

Democratic process would take care of the differing viewpoints; but
the state's official ideology is what these morons mumble, so they
linger, and once in a while get to be part of coalitions which is a
problem. The state needs to stop picking sides, correct its narrative,
the democratic process would take care of the rest.

There are TR parties who stress the nat identity more, yes.

But this identity is supposedly shared by everyone, why are there
parties stressing it? Notice not talking about conservatism, nor
defending cultural values per se. These parties are about a particular
wording. Why? Well the reason is that the label, and its underlying
narrative is bunk. It has little relation to the culture it supposedly
'labels'. With so much abject stupidity naturally there are
disagreements, and viewpoints around the label, which should be above
politics, and some of those viewpoints on the pro side form parties.

*DÃ¶ner* (tigger gyro, the word means 'it turns') was not invented
[in Berlin](2013/12/inventions-of-kebabic-kind.md). Dish is not "Turkish"
either.. Armenian *tarna* is the same thing and older, was around
before that, and guess what the word means in Armenian.

The Atlantic: "The Biden team views inequality much more as something
molded by human hands, the result of policies that have weakened
workers and strengthened corporations' marketplace leverage. To a
greater degree than Obama's and especially Clinton's teams, it
believes that generating widely shared prosperity isn't possible
without aggressive government intervention"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
