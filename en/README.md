"Nikola Corp. (NASDAQ: NKLA), its European joint venture manufacturing
partner IVECO and German pipeline company OGE will work together to
transport hydrogen to stations serving commercial fuel cell electric
vehicles (FCEVs). The 124-mile natural gas pipeline network will move
hydrogen from where it is produced to hydrogen stations. Nikola will
not begin heavy-duty fuel cell truck production until late 2022.

A lot of details of the three-way partnership remain uncertain, such
as roles and responsibilities and how the collaboration will govern
itself. 'We believe this collaboration, in particular, presents a very
compelling long-term fueling distribution solution that we expect to
advance industry and overall market adoption of FCEV technologies,'
Nikola President of Energy and Commercial Pablo Koziner said in a
press release"

"One country that has already seen significant growth in fuel cell
usage is South Korea. POWER reported on three new electricity
generating facilities based on fuel cell technology that were deployed
in South Korea last summer: a 50-MW power plant placed in service by
Hanwha Energy at its Daesan Industrial Complex in Seosan, a 19.8-MW
installation in Hwasung, and an 8.1-MW facility in Paju.

'Part of the magic that we‚Äôre seeing in Korea as it relates to
stationary power using fuel cells is incentives,' said Joe Cargnelli,
director of engineering for Cummins‚Äô Fuel Cell and Hydrogen
Technologies division. ‚ÄúWhat Korea has done is they‚Äôve created
essentially the feed-in tariff for fuel cells‚Äîfor stationary fuel
cells. So, if you think back to how solar energy and wind energy got
started back in the mid-90s, it was through a solar feed-in tariff and
a wind tariff, and it started in Germany and kind of caught on, and
that‚Äôs what sort of gave solar and wind their start. Korea has done
that for fuel cells and stationary power. So, they have incentives
that promote the deployment of stationary fuel cells and [they‚Äôve
been] highly successful, and I think it‚Äôs a great strategy.'"

What defines whether a country becomes democratic or authoratic? Geo
plays a role? Russia's rivers flow in the [wrong direction](2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.md#rurivers).
Geo forms a big obstacle, then the state has to help more, then
later becomes a burden itself?

Still no excuse to get stuck where u r, utilize tech, strenghten infra, and
democratize..

Navalny has a feel for working the media, public opinion.. He rode the
momentum after his recovery, w that Putin's Palace stuff, then his
travel back to Russia, clearly with an eye towards US since the new
admin talked about defending democracy.. Whatever the tactics though,
one cannot deny he is fighting for democracy, and willing to put his
life on the line for it.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
