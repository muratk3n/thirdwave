Sun energy falling on Earth in terms of (radiation) energy is 1000
W/m2. Solar panel efficiency is 20%. That means we can generate 200
Watts from one square meter using only the sun.

Many in the world do not accept monopoly money? Not surprising.

"If you havenâ€™t yet heard about green hydrogen, youâ€™re about toâ€”in a
big way. The universeâ€™s most abundant element is among the hotter
topics in the halls of industry and government from Australia to Saudi
Arabia, along with a number of Asian, American and European
nations. By many accounts, we will soon see green hydrogen â€” green
because itâ€™s produced with renewables â€” become a new multi-trillion
dollar commodity sector, transform the energy industry and play a
critical role in fighting climate change"

We've clearly lost some ground here...nowadays an army of actual
scientist cannot see a blatant thing like lithium batteries [not
being](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2020/07/h2-numbers.html#lithium)
fit for an overall climate solution. They clearly lost their ability
to add and subtract.  There is no shortage of useless theories,
multiple universes, strings, quantum this and that... but simple
arihtmetic?  No can do.

Good scifi foresight does exist. AC Clarke talked abt satellites way
before their time, in many ways inspired their creation.

Article says progressive leaders helped turn out the young vote for Biden.

"Unprecedented levels of youth turnout could boost a candidate many
young people scorned only a few months ago."

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
