Conflict Stats code update: 

New [script](2019/05/confstats.md#gdelt) takes GDELT conflict data set
for past 7 days (for Iraq and Syria) and plots attacks on a map,
markers showing the "from" actor. GDELT event codes used for filtering
were 190, 194 and 195 (the "AI" isn't too accurate, so it shows some
non-attacks too. But it can give a rough idea).

The output is a snazzy Leaflet.js map, just click on the "Output" link
to see it.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
