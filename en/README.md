"Blows my mind" = "this is an awesome way of teaching and I'd love to
learn that way". And since microprocessor design is one of the hardest
subjects to teach, if it can be taught like this, we can teach
everything using the same method. No teachers required.

(Except the ones recording the videos -a select few-)

Slapping new tech on top of the old without replacing the old

For many years China, a non-democracy, had high level support in US
policy circles, so CH becomes dollar-rich. Then US movies wanted a
piece of that muneeee, but u have to go through the CH censors and
appeal to a different crowd. Ergo movies get a bunch of artificially
planted CH characters, in the *The Meg*, *Independence Day 2*, even
some in *Avengers*. These actors are not there bcz they fit the
storytelling, they are plants which pulls down the quality of your
art. This is nearly as bad, possibly worse, than SJW art.

You need vitamins (from veg or fruit). Sailors on long treks would get
gum disease from meat only diets. All food storage, all cultures have
a place for fruits for this reason. American Indian pemmican is
buffola meat but has berries mixed in.

"Cant you survive only on meat?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
