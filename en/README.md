Unfortunately UK media is giving citizens & businesses the impression
that disruption will be averted because of Boris's Brexit Deal.

They are in for a rude awakening on Friday. The lorry back-up, for
instance, will still happen because of customs checks"

"The cost of X fuel, Y fuel" is not a good way to argue for or against
any energy solution. If something is feasible engineering-wise, you
can *make* it affordable. Is oil cheap to produce? Its companies
received trillions in subsidies in the past that made this fuel
possible. Tech is subsidized, you are paying locals, you are paying to
CIA to stir shit up in the region so u can get oil. All bcz powers
that be wanted this fuel be possible, and it became possible.

"The middle" is something that *emerges* out of you being where you
are, and the other guy being where he is. You dont "try" to be the
middle.

If u preemptively chases the middle it will run away, go further to
right. You'll be like that dog chasing its own tail, never reaching
it.

But the cobmunchers, in Wash, at MSM already know this well, dont
they? That's why they keep asking for it knowing it will push the
entire spectrum towards the right.


"We should meet the other guy in the middle"

You could just take Mirai's fuel-cell and use it for an airplane? Good to know.

A summary of developments in math, CS; 2020 was a great year for these
researchers.

"[R]esearchers have designed and synthesized an effective material for
speeding up one of the  limiting steps in extracting hydrogen from
alcohols. The material, a catalyst, is made from tiny clusters of
nickel metal anchored on a 2D substrate. The team led by researchers
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (Berkeley Lab) Molecular
Foundry found that the catalyst could cleanly and efficiently
accelerate the reaction that removes hydrogen atoms from a liquid
chemical carrier. The material is robust and made from earth-abundant
metals rather than existing options made from precious metals, and
will help make hydrogen a viable energy source for a wide range of
applications"

I have a feeling the Jews from America who "returned" have a lot to do
with that settlement activity bcz as Americans they are playing
Cowboys and Indians with the locals (some of whose ancestors were
probably true ancient Jews from the region) and have a frontier
mentality. They had their PM in Netan who speaka Americanese (better
than his Hewbrew apparently)

I want Israel to exist of course.. the arrivees were mostly European
and they have lots to give to the region, in terms of science, work
habits etc.

My favorite part from Pappe is [this](2020/06/10-myths-israel.md):

>The myth insists that the Jews who arrived in 1882 were the
>descendants of the Jews expelled by the Romans around 70 CE. The
>counterargument questions this genealogical connection. Quite a hefty
>scholarly effort has shown that the Jews of Roman Palestine remained
>on the land and were first converted to Christianity and then to
>Islam

So the Jews who "came back" to Israel are not the people "who left"?

And actually there was no leaving? Bloody hell.. But then who the hell
are all these Jews who are "coming back" to Israel? They must be like
Madonna, enthused by Kaballah or whatever (I so wanna try that) and
their children's children are these Jews who are "returning".

Some even converted for tactical reasons, Asimov:

>About 600 C.E., the Khazars, lived in what is now southern
>Russia. They established an empire that reached its peak about 750
>C.E., [and] about that time, the Khazars adopted Judaism as the stat
>religion, [probably] to keep from falling under the influence of
>either the Byzantine Christians or the Arab Moslems

ROFL. Where is the culture?  Where is "heritage"? You convert to
*tactical* reasons? And some of the descendants of these people come
to the region and push Palestenians off their land? Dam.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
