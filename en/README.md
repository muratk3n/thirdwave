I keep saying fossil companies can be part of the solution. Huge part,
even.. Renewable fuel economy would play into their strengths.

EM is a good guy. Strong H2 supporter.

"[Former Obama Energy Secretary Ernest] Moniz was the featured speaker
at the inaugural session of the Stanford University Global Energy
Dialogues on June 9. In a wide-ranging discussion covering the breadth
of energy resources needed to meet our climate challenge, he said that
renewables like wind and solar will be 'critical components.' However,
we also need 'an assault across the board on all approaches,'
including longer-term storage, hydrogen, carbon capture and
sequestration, even technologies that remove carbon from the
atmosphere"

"@davidsirota

IMO, it is not a coincidence that they are putting Neera Tanden -- the
single biggest, most aggressive Bernie Sanders critic in the United
States of America -- specifically at OMB while Sanders is Senate
Budget Committee ranking/chair"

It's funny, these dictator types really arent that informed; Hitler
had no idea what other leaders were truly thinking, their motives.

Stalin did ok, he was had, but only for a while, figured out Adolf early
enough.

"Eat Less Red Meat, Scientists Said. Now Some Believe That Was Bad
Advice. ...  If there are health benefits from eating less beef and
pork, they are small, the researchers concluded [but eat less pork, my
advice]"

We cannot blame politicians who went along with Russiagate. It was too
easy of a narrative for the Dems, a unifier of sorts so it was
followed, pandered to. The onus and the criticism should go to / be on
the media; they chose to go along with the convenient lie. Politicians
live in the backdrop where MSM looms large.

NYT: "One of the great successes of the Republican Party in recent
decades is the relentless propagation of a simple formula for economic
growth: tax cuts.

The formula doesnâ€™t work, but that has not affected its popularity. In
part, thatâ€™s because people like tax cuts ...

It was in the context of this worldview that it became popular to
argue that tax cuts would drive prosperity. Rich people would invest,
productivity would increase, wages would rise.

In the real world, things are more complicated. Wages are influenced
by a tug of war between employers and workers, and employers have been
winning. One clear piece of evidence is the yawning divergence between
productivity growth and wage growth since roughly 1970. Productivity
has more than doubled; wages have lagged far behind.

The point is not that economists were completely wrong. Productivity
obviously plays a role in determining wages. McDonaldâ€™s cannot pay
workers more money than it collects from its customers. But economists
were partly and consequentially wrong. Power mattered, too"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
