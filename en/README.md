Just saw F24 bit on green tech and they talked abt Airbus H2
plans. This is serious... And why shouldnt it be? H2 have been used in
rockets for space for years.

Court packing/busting filibuster/adding states all make sense to
me. We were in cooperate/cooperate for decades, but we are obviously
in defect/defect now, so we need a punishment period and probably a
reconstituted Republican party to rebuild the efficient equilibrium"

"If you get your news from the political press and television ads, you
might think the US supreme court is a forum that only adjudicates
disputes over the most hot-button religious and civil rights
issues. What you would not know is that while the court does
periodically rule on those important matters, it spends as much or
more of its time using business-related cases to help billionaires and
corporations rig the economy against ordinary Americans.

In light of that, Amy Coney Barrett’s US supreme court nomination must
be understood as the culmination of cynical tactics that Republicans
have perfected over the last two decades. The strategy is
straightforward: they nominate plutocrat-compliant judges knowing that
the corporate-owned media and political system will make sure
confirmation battles focus on partisan wrangling and high-profile
social issues – but not also on the economic issues that justices
often decide"

Covid killed 1 mil so far, roughly in one year, mostly old.

Traffic accidents kill and injure just as much, mostly young.

"Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death among young
people between 10 and 24 years, according to a new report published by
WHO. The report, Youth and Road Safety, says that nearly 400 000 young
people under the age of 25 are killed in road traffic crashes every
year. Millions more are injured or disabled"

Invading Iraq, say for democracy, would undoubtedly goad Iran into
action (Iraq has majority Shite, same as Iran). And once beligerent
action starts, others would have a reason to step in. The endgame
still could be a whopping Iranian invasion.

TR? The odd thing is, after 2003 many nationalists in TR started to
get quesy... A bestselling 2004 novel *Metal Fırtına* (Metal Storm)
for instance depicts tiggers being invaded. But u r a NATO ally and a
democracy.. Why would u care? So thought "what crawled up your behind
this time, f-nuts?". They are bothered some inane thing or another all
the time.. But then I realized if u think non-democracies are in
danger and you see yourself as one, then you would perceive a threat,
wouldn't you? All of a sudden there don't be a coup every 10 years,
minorities might get representation. Alas post 2015 we saw a decrease
of democracy and a rise of nationalism. So maybe people who saw a
threat did act.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
