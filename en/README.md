Greenwald: "Critics of Silicon Valley censorship for years heard the
same refrain: tech platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter are
private corporations and can host or ban whoever they want. If you
don’t like what they are doing, the solution is not to complain or to
regulate them. Instead, go create your own social media platform that
operates the way you think it should.

The founders of Parler heard that suggestion and tried...

But today, if you want to download, sign up for, or use Parler, you
will be unable to do so. That is because three Silicon Valley
monopolies — Amazon, Google and Apple — abruptly united to remove
Parler from the internet, exactly at the moment when it became the
most-downloaded app in the country"

Sure, overturn. Whaddamuck do people know anyway... They should not
legislate which is akin to mob rule. 

"A group of Uber and Lyft drivers in California filed a lawsuit Tuesday
in state supreme court to overturn a ballot measure that allows the
companies to continue treating its workers like independent
contractors. The drivers claim that Prop 22, which was approved by
California voters last November, violates the state’s constitution by
'stripping' the state legislature’s ability to empower workers to
organize, as well as by 'illegally' excluding ride-hail drivers from
the state workers’ compensation program"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
