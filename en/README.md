America has a problem with its bloated prison-law-enforcement system
(ahem, highest incarceration rate in the world). Defunding it a bit
is... not crazy? — and in fact this has already started since 2010"

F24: "How did we go from calls to research the origins of Covid-19 to
China's call to boycott Australian wine? Relations between Beijing and
Canberra started to seriously go south back in May when the
Australians demanded an independent probe into Coronavirus. Now, on
the week of first anniversary of the first documented case in Wuhan
comes an official protest from prime minister Scott Morrison over the
image of an Australian soldier holding a bloody dagger up to the
throat of an Afghan child, tweeted from the official account of a top
foreign ministry spokesperson"

Iran deserves more of the blame on the Yemeni situation than SA. 

"For at least a decade, there have been numerous Yemeni, Saudi, and
other countries’ assertions that Iran has been involved in supporting
northern Yemeni rebels seeking autonomy from the Sana’a
government. Iranian diplomatic and political support for this
rebellious group (known as the Houthis) is undeniable, but Iranian
military assistance for them has not always been easy to prove. This
situation appeared to change in 2011 when Iran's increased involvement
in Yemen occurred in response to both the chaotic situation there
during the final year of the Saleh regime and the danger that the Arab
Spring revolutions would leave Iran increasingly isolated. Evidence of
Iranian efforts to supply weapons to the Houthis now seems
overwhelming in contrast to uncertain reports prior to 2011"

Secretary of the Navy Braithwaite says "the decision has been made" on
the establishment of an expeditionary First Fleet to patrol the Indian
Ocean (50:17). Looks like this is happening, unless reversed by the
Biden administration"

"@ChrisBurkeShay

.@susie_c has a terrific piece outlining how health care consolidation
made us all more vulnerable to a pandemic. Our system isn't designed
for care; it's designed to maximize profit"

Despite President Duterte’s much-vaunted 'pivot to China,' the
nation’s relationship with the US remains as strong as ever"

Biden seems prepared for SCOTUS to strike down Obamacare next year: We
have 'got to end the rural health care crisis right now by building on
Obamacare, assuming it survives at all'"

I dont understand why some still keep harping about the Electoral
Collage system... The electoral votes per state are already in
proportion to the individual state population, so there is no danger
of, say, Wyoming (3 electoral votes) overwhelming a state like
Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes). Sure bcz of winner-takes-all nature
of the process on state basis, some discrepancy can occur between
popular vote and the electoral result, but that'll push the candidates
care more about individual states which IMO is a good thing. Also the
system makes democracy more indirect rather than direct, which again,
is awesome. The system is perfect the way it is.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
