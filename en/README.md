Assump was I cld take any shape (defined in a CAD file) apply virtual
wind in a virtual wind tunnel and see the forces acting on it, with
medium level computation. Not possible. At least not thru anything
widely known. Paper below is from 2014.

Which brings me back to  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

So much stuff is undone.. I thought we were further ahead in many
things..  especially aerodynamics.

"New Theory of Flight.. The new theory of drag and lift of a wing is
fundamentally different from the textbook theory.. [The old]
Prandtl-Kutta-Zhukovsky theory which was developed shortly after
powered flight was shown to be possible by the Wright brothers in
1903, breaking the perceived mathematical impossibility of powered
flight based on Newton‚Äôs incorrect theory of lift from air hitting the
wing from below. We find that the textbook theory of flight attributed
to Prandtl-Kutta-Zhukovsky is incorrect, since it is based on
phenomena which are not carried by solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations"

YT channel folk had started to sound like drugged up all of a sudden
turns out I unwittingly changed the playback speed to 0.75.

ENG scored so early and didn‚Äôt seem to know what to do after
that. Invited pressure and paid price, but this experience part of
their growth. They will be back.

ITA impeccable under Mancini and deserved winners. Outstanding all
through tournament. Auguri!"

"Bringing it home", sounds catchy. But I am rooting for the Quaquaalude.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
