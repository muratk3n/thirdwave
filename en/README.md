technologies"

@Dr_ThomasZ

Two of the next four candidate missions for @NASASolarSystemâ€™s Discovery Program are focused on Venus, as is Europeâ€™s EnVision mission, in which NASA is a partner. Venus also is a planetary destination we can reach with smaller missions

---

It's funny I was watching an interview with Peter Beck (RocketLab) he
was saying Venus loooks intreresting a week before the discovery I
made a note of it, than the news

So you can change $\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{3}$ into
$\dfrac{\frac{1}{2}}{3}$. Less cramming of fonts into small space when
divisions are involved.

`\dfrac`, exactly what i needed...

"@JoeBiden

We can't allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to
Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.

Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon
respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard
border. Period"

Einstein advice on being useful is now more relevant than ever; bcz of
decaying system a slap on the back / "success" / wealth might not
always indicate value. Fictional character Gordon Gekko was
successful, but was he useful?

I've had cases with notebooks when keyboard repair was too bothersome,
whole comp had to be replaced. This way u cld simply replace the
external keyboard.

They sell portable monitors, plugs right into RPi.. Even notebook for
daily work can be replaced... ðŸ¤” Rpi, keyb, monitor, all seperate,
seperately replaceable.

When Saudi Arabia allowed movie theather for the first time, BP was
the first movie they showed in cinemas. I wonder why...

That's not what *Black Panther* was about.. It was abt simply having a
black king on screen, about "representing". R, e, s, p, e, c and t.

Which is *sorta* fine... There are so many movies abt European kings,
queens, why not a black king? This issue bears a similarity to the
minority billionaire issue though.. The main problem isn't having more
representation among billionaires. The problem is the very presence of
billionaires. We need to come to a point where kings and queens aren't
even inspirational anymore, but seen as despicable. For everyone.

"Black Panther [was abt c]an a good man be a king, and would an
advanced society tolerate a monarch ?"

Finally found the famous Matlab `wind.mat` file (has wind speed
vectors at x,y,z locations). Ashamed to admit I spent a while
afternoon looking for the f-ing thing. But now the code replicating
Matpunk demos will be *awesome*.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
