Our information ecosystem is controlled by a few commercial entities
who operate based on profit motive- not on user experience or public
good. Flag of Australia \#facebooknewsban is an impt moment of
disruption. We can’t let it go to waste. Bring on public digital
infrastructure!"

The fact that Texans have to shop for electricity from middle-man
companies that don’t actually generate power has always baffled
me. Remember to lock in your rate every year or you’ll get kicked onto
a variable rate plan and pay thousands to shiver in a dark, frozen
house"

Can confirm. Was literally in those meetings ~13 years ago during
Windows 7 development. There's also a generic device icon we called a
beer fridge because a smart fridge seemed absolutely silly at the
time.

Before eat dont forget to rehydrate (can hurt some stomach dry),
boil in water (dont throw away water, nutr in there).

Coupled with some aminos, covers all bases.

Yea, typical output of 5 kw cannot drive such a system

"An electric furnace is a type of heating system which utilizes
electricity to heat the home, often using a fan to provide forced-air
through the home's ducts. It is generally more expensive to heat a
home using electricity rather than natural gas or other [wink wink H2]
sources of fuel. The cost of running an electric furnace varies
significantly depending on the size of the home, the type of electric
furnace used, cost of electricity, and the climate. Electric furnaces
range from 10 kilowatts to 50 kilowatts, we estimate that a 2,400
square foot home using a modern high efficiency electric furnace uses
18,000 watts for heating when the furnace is being used"

This confirms what I know from motorhomes; batteries are for
non-essential appliances, Nintendo, Playstation console or whatever,
but for anything serious, AC, heating, oven, they have a gas based
solution.

"If you’re one of those homeowners looking to add a home battery
system to your solar installation .. things you should know
... Whole-home backup protection is not possible for very long. No
residential storage system on the market has enough power and storage
capacity to run an entire home, regardless of their
advertising... Most homes use between 20 and 60 amps or more of power
per hour. High-amperage appliances like air conditioning, electric
ovens, and electric water heaters use massive amounts of power when
running, so whole-home backup is not realistic with today’s battery
and inverter technology. What the right system can do is keep your
lights and your critical appliances on long enough to get you through
a blackout and have your solar panels recharge your battery the next
day"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
