"Once online, the [Oman] plant will use renewable energy to split water
in an electrolyser to produce green hydrogen, which is able to replace
fossil fuels without producing carbon emissions. Most will be exported
to Europe and Asia, said Alicia Eastman, the co-founder and president
of InterContinental Energy, either as hydrogen or converted into green
ammonia, which is easier to ship and store. The facility aims to
produce 1.8m tonnes of green hydrogen and up to 10m tonnes of green
ammonia a year"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
