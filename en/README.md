The Atlantic: "The lower 48 U.S. states are divided into two big
electrical grids‚Äîexcept for Texas, which maintains its own independent
system. (Small, outlying parts of the state belong to the big grids.)
The state maintains a separate grid to avoid having to comply with
federal regulation. If Texas had been connected to the broader
national grid, the state might have been able to borrow power that
would have filled the hole left when large parts of the system failed
in this storm: As demand for energy for heating surged, power plants
went offline, equipment froze, and wind turbines froze too. Instead,
Texas has experienced staggering blackouts"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
