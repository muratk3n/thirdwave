Interesting theory.. dude claims the Islamic prayer direction was
changed early in its history, they plotted early mosques' direction,
it points towards the city of Petra. The claim is Mohammad is even
from that general region.. The famous "cave", going by its
description, fits there too. Dam

Cuba issue is toxic for Dems in Florida.. Treading carefully is
advised.. Otherwise there is an *el voto* and it will be for

serious in Spanish?

EL VOTO CASTIGO

"Approved by the Clinton Administration's Justice Department, the raid
on April 22, 2000, to take custody of Elián González was emotional and
dramatic—and so was its impact on Cuban-American voters. In the view
of Miami-based pollster Sergio Bendixen, 'It was humiliating to
Cuban-Americans, and the 2000 election was payback.' They called it
*el voto castigo*, or 'the punishment vote.' Whom did Cuban-American
voters punish? Democratic nominee Al Gore and his fellow Democrats"

"By late April, more than 80% of the world’s COVID-19 vaccines had
gone to people in wealthy countries, with just 0.3% to people in
low-income countries... Currently, older and medically vulnerable
individuals are dying from COVID-19 disproportionately in poor
countries, while young, healthy individuals are getting vaccinated in
wealthy ones...

What may be most pernicious about the COVAX scheme, however, is that
rich countries and their pharmaceutical companies have repeatedly used
it as a shield to deflect demands for IP waivers... Over 50 years ago,
Kwame Nkrumah observed how aid is a ‘revolving credit’ which returns
to countries of the global North in the form of increased profits. [To
a certain extent] COVAX is being leveraged to protect corporate
patents and profits..

[A solution is] focused on pooling, temporary waivers, or suspension
of IP"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
