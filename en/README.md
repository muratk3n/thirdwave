A lot of politics in this song... 

"‚ô™‚ô¨ Now I'm stocking shirts in the Wal-Mart store ‚ô™

‚ô™‚ô¨ Just like the ones we made before

‚ô™ 'Cept this one came from Singapore

‚ô¨ I guess we can't make it here anymore

‚ô™‚ô¨ Should I hate a people for the shade of their skin

‚ô¨ Or the shape of their eyes or the shape I'm in

‚ô™‚ô¨ Should I hate 'em for having our jobs today

‚ô™‚ô¨ No I hate the men sent the jobs away"

She sounds like a closer.

AOC: "But we also learned that progressive policies do not hurt
candidates. Every single candidate that co-sponsored Medicare for All
in a swing district kept their seat.  ... If you‚Äôre not door-knocking,
if you‚Äôre not on the internet, if your main points of reliance are TV
and mail, then you‚Äôre not running a campaign on all cylinders. I just
don‚Äôt see how anyone could be making ideological claims when they
didn‚Äôt run a full-fledged campaign"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
