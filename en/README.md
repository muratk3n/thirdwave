They discovered a method to produce a cheap catalyst that performs as
well as current methods, but based on tungsten.

"[E]lectrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as one of the
most important and sustainable processes for the hydrogen
production. Because of the low HER kinetics, it is necessary to use
high efficiency electrocatalysts to increase the overall process
efficiency. ...

Here, we report a simple and scalable plasma dynamic synthesis method
to form composite containing the single-crystalline nanosized cubic
tungsten carbide embedded in the carbon matrix (WC 1-x @C), which was
studied in HER both in the pure form and modified with some Pt by wet
impregnation method. It was found that even by adding 1 wt % platinum,
it is possible to significantly increase the catalytic activity of the
WC 1-x @C composite, while with the addition of 10% platinum allows
reaching almost the same properties as for commercial Pt/C sample"

These guys are developing a capsule technology to carry H2 to
whereever it's needed, especially for aviation needs. Good company to watch.

There is no comparison. H2 storage capacity is nearly limitless. If
there is water, we can get H2. Double the panel capacity double the
fuel. As simple as that.

"How does storage of H2 vs bats compare?"

How to understand a certain country with dumb ni--rs at the helm..
You start with a child. What does a child want? Wants to do grown-up
things, right. Drive like one, be like one.

<img width="340" src="https://cdn.cdnparenting.com/articles/2018/04/578115136-H.jpg"/>

But if the child type is dysfunctional, s/he wont know what those
grown-up things are, will instead do things that *appear* grown-up,
like this kid, with imaginary steering wheel, and make car sounds
"wroomm wrooom". In gov that'll be vevy vevy big bridges, vevy vevy
big wars... wout knowing whether these things are useful or not. This
is the sad truth.

They are very similar. With golf you sorta walk around too, like
regular daily life chill, then you go to a certain point, stop,
concenrate, strain.. strain.. Boom!

That's exactly like taking a shit.

"You say golf is similar to a number two. How so?"

"@jimmy_dore

I had many spirited debates about censorship in the TYT studio, I was
warning that being pro-censorship will always come back to bite the
left even harder. Reminder: No matter how much you hate someone who is
speaking, The antidote to bad speech is more speech, not censorship.

Making something float is much easier than making it sink. Calcs for a
platform... 3x2x8 meter design, with two stacks of empty barrels in
it, pour concrete over it, put a **ton** of weight on top, this
conrete slab would still float. 

Barrel, 0.16 m^3. 35 in = 0.89 meter. Concrete density 2400 kg / m3.

```python
w = 3; h = 2; l = 8
concw = (w*h*l - w*1.2*l) * 2400
concv = w*h*l
ow = 1000.0
"%0.2f, %0.2f" % (concw+ow, concv*1000.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '47080.00, 48000.00'

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
