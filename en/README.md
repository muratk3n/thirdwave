CH doesnt have to lie on its GDP numbers; the number could be
"juiced", based on dumb expenditure, not innovation. Wanna double GDP,
build another ghost city. Dig up holes, fill them back up again. Done.

Reminder:

1) Long-range over land H2 pipelines can transport 10 times more
energy than long-distance electricity transmission lines at one eight
the cost.

2) There are already 1,600 miles of H2 pipelines in US.

Proven tech.

If more work was offloaded to other kinds of social workers, than
there'd be less need for police, than less funds for them; ergo it'd
be *defunding the police*. Notice this is not the same as saying "f..k
the police", merely reducing the need for the police.

transitioned to non-police public safety workers: Across five cities,

mining, and it should allow its money base to expand, ad infinitum

bubble.. Defying all odds, dogecoin is now worth $40 billion, and its
price has risen by a whopping 300% in the last seven days"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
