Now I got the song stuck in my head

"bitch better have my money!"

Joking aside, Arduino usage can get obtuse. ALso not pure X.

Arduiono is guinea. Go north, whenever u can, for all things...

"Why not Arduiono instrad of Pi?"

Foldable, light keyboard.. Looks good

<img width="240" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdmKJH7WAAAHeAz?format=jpg&name=small"/>

Maybe I should shift my uber-portable-light computing setup from phone
to a Raspberry Pi based one, over foldable keyb. Phones will never be
Unix enough for me, Pi is pure X out-of-the-box.

Interesting read...

"Belgium and Ireland argued for and succeeded in getting a 5 billion
Brexit fund that will support the countries worst-hit by Brexit. The
fund is a reminder that the Brexit negotiations are not on track and
there is no sign of real progress"

You look at work done, vs power expanded, the ratio is efficiency. In
order to move a 1000 kg car to overcome friction have it go at
reasonable speed you need to apply constantly 200 Newtons of
[force](http://www.cimt.org.uk/projects/mepres/alevel/mechanics_ch6.pdf).
Take a bitch [BEV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S)
with 426 km (265 mile) range and 85kWh battery gross weight 2000kg.
Work done is Newton-meters, equaling Joules, which is 1/3600
Watt-hours, Force is 400 Newtons for 2000 kg car,

```python
work = (426*1000*400) / 3600.
print (np.round(work / 85000 * 100), '%')
```

```text
56.0 %
```

"How can you calculate BEV efficiency as 60%?"

I heard of this dude in Istanbul back when l he went from the European
side to Asian, and the trip was so arduous, adventerous for him that
he wrote a book about it. A trip that can be done in a few hours by
train today.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
