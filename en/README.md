What wld someone's first impression of Anthony Hopkins be? Classically
trained actor, has that posh accent, probably watches those artsy
movies all the time.. But the guy isnt like that.. He likes action. He
watches Schwarzenegger movies. He said so in an interview. So u
thought something abt the guy, but he was something else. He clearly
likes the genre, he keeps playing roles in them!

Calculating distance ratios for Moon and the Sun, ancient times.

Dude waited until it was half moon, then he knows Earth-Moon-Sun are
at right angle (light has to hit perfectly from one side for that half
shadow to happen),

<img width="340" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png"/>

Then he estimates angle $\varphi$, around 87 deg (point to one, then
swing arm to the other, angle covered is $\varphi$). Now u got your
right angle triangle, can do basic trig; What is S/L? Reverse of cosine,
$1/\cos(\varphi)$ 

```python
"%0.2f" % (1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)))
```

```text
Out[1]: '19.11'
```

The sun is roughtly 19 times further than the Moon.

I dont like ragging on govs on vaccs, I know many are doing their
best. But IMO we are stuck with some sucky infra, this cant be the
setup we meet the next pandemic with.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
