CNBC: "Siemens Mobility to work on hydrogen tech for trains after
signing agreement.. Siemens Mobility has signed a memorandum of
understanding with a Germany-based organization to undertake joint
research into the use of liquid organic hydrogen carrier technology in
the railway sector...

According to Siemens Mobility, LOHC technology involves an organic
carrier liquid absorbing hydrogen, releasing it only when
required. Among other things, the company says this stops hydrogen
escaping as a gas and negates the need for it to be stored at low
temperatures or high pressure. Transportation, it adds, is
inexpensive"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
