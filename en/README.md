Combining H2 with CO2 (from the "air") to create synthetic kerosone,
so overall you are carbon neutral (took from air, goes back to air no
difference)? This method can lead to cheating.. They'll take CO2 from
f-ing whereever, and slap a "neutral" label on it. Before VW cheating
scandal I might supported it, now I cant.. The best way to to enforce
green is at the end-user level, and you regulate the production (or
make it completely green) then the rest is safe.

Rebuilding things from basic elements seems to be my fate

F yeah bro this powerbank has a builtin camp light, can be charged
through my panels, its 2A output runs Raspberry Pi and Im guessing 3A
output will even run a NVidia dev board. With $30 HDMI portable
monitor the whole package is as good as a notebook.

Yes I am looking at the latest edition.

This is why I carpet bomb with reading material, they eff shit up so
insanely bad.

$f(x,p,t)$ is the *probability* of finding molecule in certain phase
mofo.. The *number* of molecules is $f(x,p,t) \Delta x \Delta p$. How
can major book mess that up?

Li-on bats are 1.8 MJ/liter, so they arent even in the running. Plus
they weigh a ton, plane will nose dive, going that way üëé

Airbus A330 has a range of 11,750 km. If you halve that, can still
cross the Atlantic which is around 5,000 km.

Crossing the Pacific.. at ~ 7,000 km (LA-Tokyo), bit harder, refuel at
Alaska? Or increase tank size little more.. Solutions can be found.

How to solve the green aviation problem?

Current jet fuel used is kerosene (one of the most densest form of
energy) w energy content 34.69 MJ/litre.

Liquified H2 has 8.5 MJ/liter

Then a suggestion could be, pending new developments, double fuel tank
size, and halve the range of planes. Dunno what else to say, greening
will have consequences. But I am guessing if sufficient fire is lit
under their ass, aircraft makers will innovate in a gif. Airbus chief
is [lighting](https://twitter.com/GuillaumeFaury/status/1280846469680050176)
that fire I see (or feeling it), he laid out a goal, so subseq inno
should be possible.

Should I go on with the Middle Ages analogy? There is mainstream,
stuck in the mud, quacks, and also there are the new ultra-rich, the
new Medicis? For a while there were even pirates! Crusades?! WTF man..

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
