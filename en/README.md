It's crazy to compare WWII tech to today. They had everything, albeit
less sleek form. They had INS (inertial nav systems). They had
bazookas. Even the beginnings of a computer.

Simply trying risky stuff wont lead to optimal results. Taking
moderate risk on obscure things might be a better road to
success. Obscurity cld have to do with many things.. Fashion is one of
them.  Certain things fall out of fashion, therefore taken out of the
realm of possibilities altogether. What leaders need to do then is not
just showing "courage" on stuff that are around, but finding ideas
that might have been obscured for whatever reason.

I spent 12 years in Congress. It’s not divided
because people don’t know how to play nice.  It’s divided because some
think the rich don’t have enough money and everyone else has too
much. Candidates who claim that they’re going to walk in and “mediate”
are naive or dishonest.

23,000 kilometers. Crazy. 

"By 2040, a hydrogen network of 23,000 km is foreseen, 75% of which
will consist of converted natural gas pipelines ...  [the network] can
be used for large-scale hydrogen transport over longer distances in an
energy efficient way, also taking into consideration hydrogen imports"

"No-one needs reminding that aviation faces two crises. One of course
is Covid-19; hitting finances, operations and staff- and

get serious about decarbonisation"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
