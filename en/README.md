"South Africa could tap into export potential of $100bn with new
hydrogen valley..  South Africa is set to exploit the vast hydrogen
market with a new collaboration signed today (31st March) which aims
to explore the feasibility in developing a hydrogen valley near
Johannesburg, Mogalakwena and Kwazulu Natal.

The primary angle is to decarbonise transport sectors as well as
exploiting surrounding industry, in particular its platinum resources,
which could create a domestic hydrogen economy of up to $10bn per year
and tap into an export potential of $100bn annually"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
