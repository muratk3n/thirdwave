Maybe 1 shld see these products as moonshots; experiments, trials
rather than essential items. That is the conandrum for many products
spit out by capitalists tho, sometimes the prod itself isnt enough,
one must create the need for them.

It's weird when I had to do food conserving, the simplest veg/meat
cook/save method worked for me; But I [grew
up](2011/08/living-in-factory.md) around a plant whose sole purpose
was turning out products to conserve food... Wouldn't I just buy one
of them? What does that say about capitalism?

"@ZaidJilani

Well yes people do sometimes say things that are wrong, that is part
of speaking freely. For instance, the New Yorker publishing mountains
of material making the case for a war with Iraq on false pretenses.

Just saw Bernie on CNN talking similarly.


"The current negotiations are focused on a $908 billion bipartisan plan
that includes more money for small businesses, additional federal
unemployment benefits and money for testing, vaccine distribution and
schools. Republican leaders have insisted that any coronavirus bill be
limited in scope, but Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told reporters this
week that he is urging President Trump to veto any bill that doesn't
include checks for individual Americans. 'I continue to be flummoxed
as to why there aren't any direct payments on it'"

Dunno what'll happen in the future, but Biden was against the 2011
intervention in Libya, which subsequently became "a shitshow", (as
admitted by Obama himself). Then SecDef talks started for 2020 and ppl
kept saying it'll definitely be the freako biatch. In fact I'd hear
"everyone's post is up in air *except Flournoy*". Man I saw that in so
many places, u r like 'well shit, this coronation is pre-ordained' no
point in discuss.. Then all of a sudden it's not Flournoy, one of the
ppl who convinved Obama on Libya. Is this the reason, dunno. But it is
something...

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
