By football I mean the sport where u kick the ball around.

Sport means all parts of the player needs to MOVE.

Ping Pong is a sport. Even golf, which is closer to taking a shit than
football, is a sport.

"But what defines a sport? Increased heart rate? [trying to justify
calling pro gaming a sport]"

Of course.. people in US living near Canada used to cross over to to
buy "cheap" insulin there, but with the border closed now they are
screwed. They are like rationing and shit, and sharing.. ? Crazy.

US has fairly stable neighborhood. Protected by two oceans from both
sides, imperial powers gone, calm Canada to North, now pieceful
relations with Mexico. The neighborhood around the Caucasus, ME, not
so calm.

The Daily Poster: "There’s an impulse to try to turn Trump’s tax
shenanigans into a story only about Trump — as if he is a singular
villain. But while he deserves much criticism for gaming the system,
we can’t ignore the fact that it is a system — one that allows wealthy
people like Trump avoid paying $266 billion of taxes every single
year"

Lol at this offhand detail in the Times piece: 'Nor do [tax records]
reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia.'"

BTW, once you bet on the simplest, most efficient tech basis (key
decision in engineering) then you can innovate easier on more parts of
the problem, simultaneously. Maybe in the future H2 wont be in tanks
anymore, but in metallic form, or in ammonia, or somewhere
else... These can all be seperately innovated on, while the base
architecture remains the same. So cars can anchor on H2 as fuel, and
further innovation gets you that fuel more and more
efficiently. Infrastructure, adaption, TCO are all part of it.

FT: "The world’s biggest aircraft maker Airbus unveiled 'historic'
designs for hydrogen-fuelled passenger planes on Monday. A few days
later, the world’s first sizeable aircraft to be powered by hydrogen
took flight. It was piloted by start-up ZeroAvia, based in California
and Cranfield, England. A commercial launch might be just three years
away, it says.

As aviation comes under pressure to curb emissions, investment in
hydrogen is being stepped up. Hopes of using battery technology as a
green alternative to jet fuel are fading. Batteries are just too heavy
for long flights, given their low energy density. Airbus, with
Rolls-Royce, closed a demonstrator project in April. ...

The EU is pushing green hydrogen hard, arguing that it could meet
nearly a quarter of world energy demand by 2050. The UK government,
which backed the ZeroAvia venture, is also keen"

What of the debates? IMO only the last one counts. I'd limp throughout
the first two and open the can of whoop ass on the third. Kerry could
not finish the job on the last one, and did not get the title as the
'winner of the debates'.

They are there to tip the balance, to decide between submerge or
rising to surface. I think a sub is built with juust enough weight
right at the edge of that balance; then filling tanks or emptying them
tips the scale either way. Tanks alone could not do that. You can't
balance a force proportional to displaced water with just water.

"But you said subs require weight.. What are those tanks [taking water
in] are for then?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
