I killed it with that stew.. That'll be one awesome dish when it
comes out of storage. "Low and slow" does it.

Monoliths? Who cares?

Arent nationalist supposed to be more connected to the war of indep?

The main enemy then was the British, but these loser nats now became
poodles of UK intelligence, if reports are correct.. Isn't that sad?

They should learn from TR. By now some nationalist corksucker would
have blown something up, their symphatizers in gov would then blame
the people who died, jail their movement, subsequentlyl watch the
mainstream politicians tremble, then fall in line like scared little
bitches.

You have a lot to learn.

Another Israeli election? Hell

They are in a funk, and they deserve to be. Too many ethnic divisions,
foundational issues.. The representative makeup is actually suggesting
a way out / the solution (there is certain magic in electoral
representative structure from elections) but mainstream is too set in
their ways.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
