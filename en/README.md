NEWS: A major fossil fuel company pumped an average of $12,000 into
politics every single day for 2 years & just got a top court to bless
its move to keep the money 100% anonymous. The case could set a
precedent for all corporate spending to buy elections"

What made Russiagate unique as a conspiracy theory is that you need a
college degree to believe it, because it requires a special sort of
stupidity only conferred by higher education"

"The hydrogen hydride alloy used in Lavo is based on a technology that
emerged after WWII, where hydrogen molecules attach to metals such as
magnesium or aluminium. Professor Kondo-Francois Aguey-Zinsou, chief
scientist and executive director of Lavo and lead researcher in
hydrogen technologies at UNSW, has been researching hydrides for more
than 20 years. Muller says Aguey-Zinsou has 'cracked the code' with
the alloy used in the Lavo storage system"

Hydride based H2 storage was listed [here](2020/10/h2-storage.md).

They use a form of metal hydride apparently.

With the aim of powering a cleaner, more sustainable future through
its cutting-edge hydrogen storage technology, Australian technology
and lifestyle company Lavo officially launched on Tuesday (20th Oct)"

Plug Power CEO: "Power Density and Range: fuel cell energy density is
four times more than batteries, and a tank of hydrogen contains more
than double the energy of a battery at the same weight. Fuel cells
allow easy scalability for users to increase range without the
elimination of cargo space. This is important in middle-mile and
long-haul green mobility markets.  In these applications, you must
double the batteries on board to double the range of a
battery-electric vehicle. With fuel cells, to double the range, you
only have to add more hydrogen.  That supports a 50-60% increase in
payload versus battery electric vehicles"

It's not surprising fascists sometimes [offering](2020/07/right-acting-left.md) left
solutions. While it's fine to get some left policies, you really don't need the
accompanying drama, or deaths, and the errant stupidity.

"[T]he Brasilian government launched the benefits ... with an average
monthly benefit of $163 per home. Now the relief is also providing an
unlikely popularity boost for Bolsonaro"

They have a Hoboken too. And it's likely theirs is the original.

Ankara and Moscow have closer ties than Ankara and Paris. Russia
killed dozens of Turkish troops in March and Ankara chose to pretend
the Syrians did it"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
