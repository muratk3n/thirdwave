Uncle Don acted like corporatist sadly. In near past.

But we got to see libs squirm and had some good TV.. Cant complain.

"The US corporate tax rate was slashed from 35% to 21%. The
consequence? Federal corporate tax revenues have fallen by almost half
from 2017 to 2018.13 We’ll return at length to this development, but
it’s worth recording here its most direct implication: low corporate
taxes mean the ultra-rich, whose income mostly derives from owning
shares in corporations, now really can get off almost scot-free"

Oh no, not Uncle Joe

It's a new age now, of course, we all hope for the best, prep 4 the
worst.

"The president had made overhauling taxation with dramatically lower
tax rates the top domestic priority of his second term. On that 22nd
of October 1986, about to sign into law the Tax Reform Act, he had
reason to be joyful. Starting on January 1, 1988, the country that had
pioneered the quasi-confiscatory taxation of high incomes would apply
the lowest top marginal income tax rate in the industrial world:
28%. After three weeks of floor debates, the tax bill had passed
ninety-seven to three in the Senate. Democrats Ted Kennedy, Al Gore,
John Kerry, and Joe Biden all had enthusiastically voted 'Yes.' ... To
this day, and although it is now widely recognized as one of the key
contributors to the explosion of inequality, the bill is still fondly
remembered by all those involved in its crafting"

"A fear haunted the slaveholders of the South: that non-slaveholding
majorities would use taxation to undermine—and eventually abolish—the
“peculiar institution.” They particularly feared wealth taxation: at a
time when 40% of the population in Southern states was considered
property, property taxes were an existential threat for slaveholding
planters. They fought such taxes tirelessly, and for two centuries
wielded their power to keep taxes and public institutions
archaic. How? By stifling democracy"

"It’s always possible to shrug off the risk of an entrenched
plutocracy.  To believe that whether a few super-rich own a large
fraction of the country’s wealth is irrelevant. That America’s
institutions are so strong that they cannot be captured by special
interests. That from Boston to Los Angeles, democracy will always and
forever beat plutocracy. And certainly, democracy has overcome
plutocracy in the past. It triumphed over the slaveholding plutocracy
of the South. It beat back the nascent industrialist plutocracy of the
Gilded Age"

"The second and primary culprit for the high tax rates paid by
working-class Americans is consumption taxes. The United States may
not have a value-added tax, but it has a proliferation of sales and
excise taxes that, like a VAT, make prices higher. And thereâ€™s a
twist: in contrast to regular value-added taxes, US levies exempt most
services, which the affluent consume at high rates as a percentage of
their overall spending. This twist means that the consumption of the
poor (goods) is taxed, while that of the rich (services) is largely
exempted. The United States does not have a VAT; it has a poor manâ€™s
VAT.

Do you enjoy going to the opera? No sales tax. Have a country club
membership? No sales tax. Need a lawyer? No sales tax. But if you
drive, dress, or buy appliances, sales taxes apply all the way"

"Under business as usual, income concentration is likely to keep rising
in the medium run thanks to a snowball effect: the wealthy save a
higher fraction of their income than the rest of the population, which
allows them to accumulate more wealth, which in turn generates
additional income. For most of the twentieth century, progressive
taxationâ€”and especially high tax rates on capital (as opposed to
labor)â€”had kept this spiral under control. But the tax changes of
the last two decades have dismantled this safeguard"

Of course free society will let you to live in your delusion and
that's fine. But everyone who is in the know and their job is to know,
needs to be aware.

An ethnic subculture that always stayed together, are geographically
seperate, are culturally different and feel different is one
thing...

The converse of that, spread out in many locations, geographically
split, not in a cultural ghetto, not in a big enough group, it is not
possible to remain a subculture.

It doesnt matter whatever fuck u think you are, you wont be it.

But yes, a lot of the "new" stuff is overrated, like Docker.

No new cool programming languages, or tech invented since 96..?
Hmm.. Let's not forget CUDA (2006). It might not be a full-blown
language, usually just extension to existing ones, not sleak in terms
of syntax, but it was / is a new way of appoaching programming (with
kernels etc). It gave rise to PyCuda, OpenCL, now Thrust..

IT guys do not deal with this part of computing much. In numerical
computing bunch of things are happening... Speed records are being
broken all the time, thanks to the new architectures.

This is mostly true

"But you can’t do research at a startup (I have the scars from
trying). New technology takes a long time and is very risky. The sound
business plan is to lever up with VC money, throw it at elite
programmers who can wrangle the crappy current tech, then cash
out. There is no room for technology invention in startups"

Top reasons many researchers prefer hydrogen fuel vehicles over EVs ...

* No substantial lifestyle changes are required ..
 
* H2 powered cars place less strain on the electric grid ..

* They have a larger range ..

* Practicality for a larger range of vehicles

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
