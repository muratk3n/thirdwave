Haha.. they say architecturally the GPU borrows ideas from the
Connection Machine of 80s. I'll always remember CM through Feynman's
involvement [in it](https://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/).
Feynman.. This guy was everywhere.

That' true. And simple-in-the-small wins over in the long-run, in
terms of concurrency. Many top supercomputers in the world these days
use GPUs nowadays. And its funny it all started from the graphics
community.

"GPUs and CPUs are architecturally very different devices. CPUs are
designed for running a small number of potentially quite complex
tasks. GPUs are designed for running a large number of quite simple
tasks"

I never discounted the possibility, [see UFOs](2015/08/ufo.md).

"Price of lab-grown meat to plummet from $280,000 to 10 per patty by

Lab grown meat.. so stem cells are harvested from cows, muscle stem
cells multiplies (grown) to trillions, making meat?

Then u still need *some* cows around to harvest stem cells from, but
not as many cows as we have today? That's a fair trade.

It’s over. Again. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says

"On December 3, 2020, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees
completed their conference on the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense
Authorization Act. We read all 4,517 pages so you don’t have to. The
Act includes numerous important sections on Asia. One of the most
notable is the the creation of a Pacific Deterrence Initiative
(Sec. 1251), which aims to bolster deterrence against China while also
reassuring allies and partners. But there are many other provisions
Asia watchers should note, including sections related to U.S. regional
strategy, Asian alliances, and competition with China across a variety
of departments and agencies"

"Australia enjoyed plenty of advantages over the United States in
containing Covid-19. It has no land borders to speak of. Its
population density is very low ... So they went big. The state’s
roadmap largely followed a policy proposal laid out in September by
the Grattan Institute (a nonprofit think tank supported by the state
and federal governments): 'Go for zero.' ...

'Ideally, lockdowns are only done once and done well,' the proposal’s
authors, Stephen Duckett and Will Mackey, explained. 'The benefit of
zero is to reduce the risk of ‘yo-yoing’ between virus flare-ups and
further lockdowns to contain them.'”

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
