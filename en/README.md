This is awesome man :) He gets web pages mailed to him..? Class.

And boy did the recent events prove his "paranoia" right.

Richard Stallman: "I am careful in how I connect to the
internet. Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial nonfree
Javascript code. I use LibreJS to prevent nonfree Javascript code from
running..

I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git) that
fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to me. Then I
look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy to see the text in
the HTML page directly. I usually try lynx first, then a graphical
browser if the page needs it"

That's right, he is talking about being "hood rich". You can be rich,
but how rich? Hood rich, may not be enough.

Nice.. Github lists the computer languages used in your repo in percentage.
My tutorial repo has roughly,


TeX  71.0%
 
Python 12.2%
 
Java 11.1%
 
MATLAB 2.0%
 
Common Lisp 1.3%
 
JavaScript 0.3%


That's exactly right. TeX is high in the list, obviously, the whole
thing is written in LaTeX. Python is next up, the main language of all
computations. Java is from the sub-blog, the non-math, tech part. Some
my early AI posts are in Lisp, GH caught that. Very good.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
