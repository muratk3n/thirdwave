Happy new year muthafukkas

---

My alma-mater prided itself for being an engineering school with a
strong humanity bent. You had to take lots of classes from humanities,
which all students playfully called Hum. Hummmm... which bothered some
Hum teachers, one used to tease us for the use of the word. "Are you
happy with your Hummmm?".

Well anyway, one of my Hum classes was changes tech causes on
society. The Internet had not made it to the textbooks yet, but the
so-called client-server IT had been in use for a while, like the
"groupware" Lotus Notes, and they could analyze some of
that. Groupware lets you schedule meetings, etc obviosuly. You could
see everyone's schedule, and schedule meeting accordingly. I'll never
forget one case where an exec would preemptively block out almost all
spots in his calendar, bcz he didnt want people to schedule meetings
with him, willy nilly.

You see, the introduction of tech in this picture didnt really change
anything. People fought it, and it did not create "a new way of
working" either... This was a good lesson. I guess I was already on
the way of writing this dinky stuff I write today.. 3W tech can
disturb, and may not alter "everything" wout correct social
infrastructure.

Expanse is at its best when it is showing off all that cool
tech... The horizontal / vertical elevator was awesome. It goes
reeally fast than all of a sudden goes vertical? Sweet.

Wut? They almost had the Chuck guy playing C America? They made a good
choice.. CA needs to be a little square... I cant see Lewi pulling it
off. He has too much comedy in him.

The Speaker of the House in front of a chatroom doesnt get you "the
future". Tech wout the correct backdrop may not always cause advance.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
