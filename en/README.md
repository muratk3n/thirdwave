There are many tricks in self-guided education. A simple one, and it
works even for highest level of mathematics, is proving a theorem in a
book which already has the answer. Cover the answer, try to solve; if
successful, great. If not, look at the solution, but now we see it
with all kinds of questions in our head, we learn more from the
answer.

These tricks can be taught in a seperate class on their own.

Maybe certifier can do more admin work in that sense, but in my
approach, ed will be mostly self-guided. "Not all kids can do
that". Maybe. But maybe not all kids are meant to sit down and stare
at writings all day long either. Wide-spread ed as its pursued today
pigeonholes people in so many ways.

"But in your ed system how would kids receive, and do homeworks? If
certifier will not be a teacher anymore?"

Wanting to come across as a first-rate power.. Anatolians, so-called
"Turks" want it so bad. But I think these niggers confuse acting out
end-goal with actually being it. "If I act the end goal I'll be
it". Have a white house'y place, with briefings given other than that
the exec. This is some retarded dumb ass shit...  What happened to the
process? US ended up being what it is as a side-effect of many factors
of its near past and geo. It didnt *try* to be it, and even now, many
are unhappy with the state of empire. So how can a country hailing
from the sidelines of modernity simply acting out the end-product can
get that end product?

"And, at the end of September, it was announced HS2 had been piloting
solar and hydrogen powered cabins at site locations ... Designed and
built by a firm called AJC Trailers, and supplied by GAP Group, the
buildings use solar panels backed up by a hydrogen
fuel-cell. .. Designed to be low noise, they emit only water vapor. In
relatively simple terms, a fuel-cell combines hydrogen and oxygen to
generate electricity, heat and water. Across a period of 21 weeks, HS2
said 16 of the cabins saved 112 metric tons of carbon"

Journalist would feel "the pull" for the same reasons. Hence abysmal
coverage of lower income people in the media.

So no more of this... Style over substance, technobabbling dipshittery.

Technobabbling centrism had a certain pull on Dems from another
direction.. Politics, as a job, is mainly knowledge work. It deals
with information, decision, having to adjust to an existing canon (the
law).. All that cld pull them towards financiers, Silicon Valley
honchos, etc. 

Technical knowledge is good of course, we want technically aware
lawmakers, like LBJ was in his heyday (the Apollo Moon program was his
idea), but if this turns into a *class conciousness*, we have a big
problem. Low income ppl lose representation, and Dems lose power bcz
white collar, aflluent folk, forming a mere 20% + concentrated in big
cities, cannot be of help in deciding most elections.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
