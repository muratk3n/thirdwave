Watched a docu on Coca Cola.. Guy who invented it did it for his
addiction?  He started comp, but then fell off the wagon, addiction
returned, then he died. New chief went in heavy on marketing, CC
became big. The End. I don't think I've watched a more inconsequential
business story in my life. A story of suger'ed water essentially.

And.. can this union be effective? Half the countries are on the
opposite side of the world

(Literally, like Canada and Australia)

CANZUK? A strategic union between Canada, Australia, NZ and UK?
Potentially military one? Without the US?

They will be against it vehemently and undermine it every chance they
get. That would be my first reaction.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
