"After the United Kingdom left the European Union at the start of this
year, checks and tariffs were introduced on some goods moving from
mainland Britain to Northern Ireland as the province now borders the
bloc via EU member Ireland.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had promised there would be no
hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland as result of Brexit,
and unfettered trade between the province and the rest of the United
Kingdom would continue.

But critics of the departure deal's Northern Ireland Protocol say a
border is now in effect in the Irish Sea, leaving unionists, who want
to stay in the United Kingdom, feeling betrayed"

"[I]n 1965, NASA funded a project to develop a general-purpose finite
element program by a group in California led by Dick MacNeal. This
program, which came to be known as NASTRAN, included a large array of
capabilities, such as two- and three-dimensional stress analyses, beam
and shell elements, for analyzing complex structures, such as
airframes, and analysis of vibrations and time-dependent response to
dynamic loads. NASA funded this project with 3 [mil] (like 30 [mil]
today). The initial program was put in the public domain, but it had
many bugs. Shortly after the completion of the program, Dick MacNeal
and Bruce McCormick started a software firm that fixed most of the
bugs and marketed the program to industry. By 1990, the program was
the workhorse of most large industrial firms and the company,
MacNeal-Schwendler, was a $100 million company"

Simulation is becoming more prevalent. Even for airplane
manufacturers.. they started to use wind tunnels [less and
less](https://youtu.be/2M3iVfOQ_T8?t=354), and rely more and more on
simulation. Sims can get incredibly realistic.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
