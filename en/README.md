This is what an efficient base gives you: options. H2 can power both
an FC or a traditional engine.

"What this means, in non-technical language, is that Shi [Zheng-li at
the Wuhan Institute of Virology] set out to create novel coronaviruses
with the highest possible infectivity for human cells... 'It is also
clear .. that, depending on the constant genomic contexts chosen for
analysis, this work could have produced SARS-CoV-2 or a proximal
progenitor of SARS-CoV-2.' [said researcher from Rutgers] ..

The lab escape scenario for the origin of the SARS2 virus, as should
by now be evident, is not mere hand-waving in the direction of the
Wuhan Institute of Virology. It is a detailed proposal, based on the
specific project being funded there by the NIAID"

"California coalition aims to make hydrogen power cost-competitive by 2030.. 

HyDeal Los Angeles, a green hydrogen initiative launched in Los
Angeles on Monday, aims to bring the cost of hydrogen fuel to $1.50/kg
by 2030. At that price, to achieve 100% renewable energy, blended
electricity from a hydrogen-fueled turbine and long term low cost wind
and solar PPAs could run about 35 dollars/MWh"

That much-awaited [decoupling](2021/03/goods-materials-growth-hickel.md#decouple)
did not take place. In the umpteenth step of a fully fledged knowledge econ (3W),
maybe, it cld happen. But we are far off from that.

"In discussions of climate emergency, degrowth has always been the
elephant in the room; acknowledged from time to time, but rarely
spoken about. But it may be the only solution..

To address this omission, researchers .. recently published an array
of degrowth pathways.. These show that an intentional reduction in
economic output is actually less risky than a combination of continued
GDP growth and geo-engineering. In advanced economies, degrowth would
involve a slowdown in manufacturing, accompanied by a significant
switch to green technologies and far greater focus on environmental
and ecological protection and repair.

If managed effectively, there would be no need for productivity to
fall, nor for people to become worse off. Embracing both a universal
basic income and a four-day working week would make the transition
relatively painless. Of course, a new smartphone model every year
would be out of the question, but would we really miss it?"

There u go.. even the f-ing CCP figured it out

Bcz due to loss of GDP, "growth"? Two ways to increase GDP, either
through more ppl, eg immigration, 2% more ppl 2% more growth which is
"dumb growth". Or you produce more per person, GDP Per Capita
increases, even w same amount of people (or a few skilled immigrants),
GDP increases, through knowhow = good growth.

No growth is also an option.

MSM is plugged into all sorts of places. Of course they heard the alternative theory

"[I]nside the Times, we were sharply divided. My colleagues who cover
national security were being assured by their Trump administration
sources — albeit anonymously and with no hard evidence — that it was a
lab leak and the Chinese were covering it up. We science reporters
were hearing from virologists [the opposite]"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
