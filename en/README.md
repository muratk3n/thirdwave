And STL files can be sent to a 3D printer..[ Imagine during class
simulate an object, design it, at the end, print it.

Many do not realize how far modern scripting envs have come.. Talked
to someone the other day poor guy still toiling away in Matlab. Bro -
Wake up.

Yes there are big hunking programs, like Chrono.. I'm talking about
something simpler. Reading STL files in Py is easy. Add some grav
effects, simple center of mass calc, force => movement etc.

Another subj to be added to STEM curriculum, given an physical obj
description in an STL file (CAD progs create it), learn to simulate
effects to it in 3D space, w some code (use ready lib). Apply force,
see what happens.

*The Core*, from an era of movies when stuff went wrong and you could

Disney Star Wars.

Culture is not something that is "declared", and "assumed". It is
burned in the brain through the culture around you, through osmosis at
around age 7. First generation children of immig parents are getting
the culture of their lands burned in their brains, not their
parents'. So that weirdo fuck who came in with his bags, chicken coops
and shit who talks to you with an accent -your parents- are as foreign
to you as they are to their country. That is how people who arrive into
area / cultures become part of those areas / cultures.

'Feel connected to your land', I dont just mean 'a physical
coincidence', not 'he was there, and I am there'.. I saw Golden Gate
bridge and you did too! How awesome maan.. No, I mean something
else. Think of the guy who lived on your land in the past, his
culture, if not his genes are *inside you*.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
