"Don't expect a contested election... The cone of uncertainty has
narrowed considerably. Now, the question seems to be whether we'll see
a "skinny" Biden win or a landslide"

ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ TÃ¼rker ErtÃ¼rk.. That's the man's name.

They named this asshole TurkSoldier so his full name could be
TurkSoldier SoldierTurk. ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ The crassness of the rampant, showboat
nationalism is disgusting.

The history behind these names was shared
[here](2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.md#wolf).

At another level anti-semitism is Labor's Russiagate. It unites
certain people, against certain other people.... It serves a
purpose. Obviously, just like Russiagate, is is based on half-truths,
a warped version of reality. The issue now a code word, a fraternity
secret handshake of sorts.

Give it enough time even Americans would become like that... Remember
that CNN reporter [name calling](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2696871/CNN-reporter-quickly-deletes-tweet-called-Israelis-cheering-missiles-striking-Gaza-scum.html)
leisure watchers while Palestines were being bombed? A CNN reporter!

Of course. Because they know Israel better!

Brits have some history in the area, hence the knowledge about these
things are more widespread, so their left is naturally more vocal
about it.

"But isn't it true there has been more pointed criticism of Israel in
UK, especially in Labor?"

"@lhfang

Expect a lot of sniping from the reporters behind discredited
Russiagate hysteria, hype mindless identity politics, aggregate
partisan horse race journalism & whose beliefs are uniformly identical
to whatever is popular on Twitter. The conformist mob hates principled
dissent"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
