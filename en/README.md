An idea for all countries that are victims of China's Belt and Road
loans... Remember that any loan entered into via bribery or coercion
is invalid. You can treat it as a donation made by the Chinese
Communists. We should push for a Belt and Road Jubilee"

"[N]o rain for months, the land was primed for fires. At 3 am I looked
out my window and saw people in the building across the way watching
the same synaptic arms of lightning stretch across the sky, turning it
for a moment from black to light blue. We knew this would not go well.

Over 12,000 lightning strikes were reported during the week of August
19; Cal Fire reports that in 2020 alone there have been over 7,452
fires in California and since those fires started over one 2.6 million
acres have burned, and counting. These are the worst fires in
California‚Äôs history. And they are still burning"

Ed needs to start with what they saw, and connect the dots. At the
very least tracing their steps will encourage a spirit of research in
students.

"Planets orbit in circles around the sun. One may wonder how
Copernicus determined the order of the planets and the size of their
orbits ‚Äì after all, he had no benefit of pictures from spacecraft or
even a telescope. He determined these things by measuring elongation"

He used elongations. 

"How can I teach the method Copernicus used to determine orbits?"

*The Predator* 2018 üëç That almost felt like pre-2016, good movie,
pre-SJW, pre-cuck. Ster. Brown plays a pure, hilarious asshole... I am
getting a young Charles Bronson vibe form the lead... And they had Da
Strahovski. Very foxy.

I feel like I've held it together pretty well the last six months of
pandemic pregnancy but this may be my undoing. COBRA says they sent my
payment, my insurer says they haven't received anything. They're both

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
