"The rivalry between Europe and China in emission-free hydrogen
technologies could become one of the defining business stories in the
global effort to stop climate change.

Scarred by its painful experience in solar¬†PV¬†manufacturing, which was
developed in Europe at high cost only to later move to China, Europe
is not taking any chances with hydrogen.

In a bid to outcompete China and fulfil its ambition to become
climate-neutral, Europe has launched a massive green hydrogen push to
decarbonise industry and aviation and secure promising export
opportunities"

I guess the previous announcement by Power Innovations was for Microsoft. Awesome

"Microsoft tests hydrogen fuel cells for backup power at
datacenters. In a worldwide first that could jumpstart a long-forecast
clean energy economy built around the most abundant element in the
universe, hydrogen fuel cells have powered a row of datacenter servers
for 48 consecutive hours, Microsoft announced Monday"

"The formulation that slavery was tolerated as a necessary evil at the
time of the Founding, and that the Founders expected
(overoptimistically) that it was on an inevitable path to extinction,
is a fairly standard one, and mostly an accurate way of putting the
more complicated story of Founding-era slavery and anti-slavery into a
nutshell.... The Founders‚Äô optimism was misplaced. But they *did* have
a plan; it just didn‚Äôt work out the way they expected"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
