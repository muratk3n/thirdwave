JS: "One of the leading causes of homelessness in this country is, in
fact, our shortage of low-income housing. After mental illness and
substance abuse, minimum-size standards have probably kept more people
on the street than any other contributing factor. Countless attempts
to design and build efficient forms of shelter by and for the homeless
have been thwarted by these codes.  By demanding all or nothing from
our homes, current restrictions ensure that the have-nots have nothing
at all. The U.N. Declaration of Universal Human Rights (of which the
United States is a signatory) holds shelter to be a fun- damental
human right. Yet, in the U.S.. this right is guaranteed only to those
with enough money to afford the opulence"

JS: "It is illegal to inhabit a tiny home in most populated areas of
the U.S. The housing industry and the banks sustaining it spent much
of the 1970s and 1980s pushing for larger houses to produce more
profit per structure, and housing authorities all cross the country
adopted this bias in the form of minimum-size standards. The stated
purpose of these codes is to preserve the high quality of living
enjoyed in our urban and suburban areas by defining how small a house
can be. They govern the size of every habitable room and details
therein. By aiming to eliminate all but the most extravagant housing,
size standards have effectively eliminated housing for everyone but
the most affluent Americans.

Again, the intention of these limits is to keep unsightly little
houses from popping up and lowering property values in America’s
communities and, moreover, to ensure that the housing industry is
adequately sustained. The actual results of the limits are a greater
number of unsightly large houses, inordinate construction waste,
higher emissions, sprawl and deforestation, and, for those who cannot
afford these larger houses, homelessness"

JS: "For most Americans, big houses have come to symbolize the good
life; but, all symbolism aside, the life these places actually foster
is more typically one of drudgery. Mortgage payments can appropriate
thirty to forty percent of a household’s income not counting taxes,
insurance, or maintenance expenses. When every spare penny is going
towards house payments, there is nothing left over for investments,
travel, continued education, more time with the kids, or even so much
as a minute to relax and enjoy life. At this rate, an oversized house
can start to look more like a debtor’s prison than a home"

JS is the grandfather of the tiny house movement.

Jay Shafer, 2009: "My reasons for choosing to live in such small
houses include some environmental concerns. The two largest of my
three, hand-built homes were made with only about 4,800 pounds of
building materials each, less than 100 pounds of which went to the
local landfill. Each produced less than 900 pounds of greenhouse gases
during a typical Iowa winter. And, at 89 square feet, plus porch and
loft, each fit snugly into a single parking space.

In contrast, the average American house consumes about three quarters
of an acre of forest and produces about seven tons of construction
waste. It emits 18 tons of greenhouse gases annually, and, at more
than 2,349 square feet, it would most definitely not fit into a single
parking space"

No I do not support DJT. Just pointing out the weirdness of how things
aligned recently... Not just in US, in UK and other places
too.. British Tory PM talking about a "New Deal" while the Labor
leader is going to extreme lengths not to seem pro-Palestine, sorry
"anti-Semitic". This is weird.

Academics can be smart but they are usually not software
engineers. They'll create bazillion of dependencies, the whole thing
becomes a mess. Also nothing easily demonstrable included (comes with
the territory, they earn their stripes being as obscure, "mystical" as
possible, the publishing process makes them so).

Bloody university code.

`void *`

Had not seen that for a while.

Aha. So you are not supposed to say "Im was saved bcz of the right
things I *achieved*". It was a gift to you. It is emphasizing
selflessness.

Religion is ancient time's left (it is politics). Also, it is the
self-help lit of its time. Instead of a guy with big teeth running
around teaching you how to "crush it", there is the lit on how to take
it easy, chillax, turn the other cheek once in a while.

"Ephesians 2:8 

For by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves, it is the gift of God"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
