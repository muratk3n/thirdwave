SocMed can be built around a protocol, like email is built around SMTP
protocol, and distributed on / through nodes that are owned by
whomever.

Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source
architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and
decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to
ultimately be a client of this standard"

Even studying one book, I can open multiple copies of the same PDF,
each window pointing to a different page, then can Alt-TAB between
them. Fast. Different pages from diff books, same way. Could be
Alt-TAB'bing between 10 different books without much apparent physical
activity. Try that with physical books!

No they were not.. I do not miss them at all.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
