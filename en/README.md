Geometry should take backseat to other concerns.. It is a derivative
concept, not essential. In Wolfram's approach too, space, its
dimensions [emerge](https://youtu.be/-t1_ffaFXao?t=6555) out of his
hypergraph structure.

ALex Unzic says Einstein made a mistake geometrizing relativity.

There was FF 1 then FF 2? But.. how does that connect to, like Blah
Movie 3? And that to Blah Blah 4?

After seeing decade long multi movie setups, old style mere "sequel"
sound so inconsequential.. tiny.

CSU guy, SÃ¶der. He was recently against "any expansion of the eurozone
to include countries like Bulgaria and Romania; the introduction of
Eurobonds; and the creation of a European finance minister
post". Daam.

The newly elected person is exact oppo no?

New CDU leader.  But it doesnt mean this person will be the chancellor
candidate for the general elections?

covid well.

TR parties, coalitions still largely work this way actually,
proto-fascistic cesspools into anything can be thrown in and it
floats, like certain shit does on a pool of pee.

Sure. 30s TR for example, when it was staunchly nationalist, one of
its first governors was known to have said "if communism was necessary
for this country, we would surely import it". Sounds like a joke and
it is told as such, but the guy was dead serious. There you go,
nationalist talking about utilizing communism.. Or in China today,
they are communists, but imported capitalism, and happily using
it. Italian fascists created the social security system of the country.

Intensely opposing ideologies cannot be held together under one roof
in anything other than fascism.. A whatever-it-takes attitude usually
accompanies the approach, 4 whatever reason said country fell into a
state-of-emergency mentality from which they never emerge, so they
keep on living in an hand-to-mouth existence w ideology, "I'll take
from here, I'll take from there, whatever-it-takes,
ends-justify-the-means", and on it goes.. It's no way to live.

"Could you give more examples of fascism being a grab-bag of ideologies"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
