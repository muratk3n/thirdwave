[Old is Good](2020/11/bedazzled-by-tech.md#oilwater), especially when
during the half-baked state of our transition today.

"But solutions like Medicare-for-All sound too old. Like last-century old".

It is hilarious how much water fruit, vegs contain.. A whole bag of
spinach, or cabbage fits into a single glass jar once its water is
boiled away. Taking water out is also key for long term storage as it
turns out... Same for poultry.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
