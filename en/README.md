Robitaille says mainstream science is wrong on the gas theory,

to be correct for black holes, big bang to exist.

I spoke with Rep. Rashida Tlaib about why she's leading the opposition
against calls for a massive expansion of the security state in
reaction to the Capitol attack. She said eroding civil liberties is
not the answer to holding the rioters accountable.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
