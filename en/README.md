Yes ppl need to understand the individual pieces of every approach
(that is how inno comes about) and how they are put together, not just
learn how to turn knobs on a ready-made black-box, prepackaged
solution. Demystify. 

Professor: "The simulation of non-trivial practical problems in fluid
dynamics (defined as problems in more than one dimension) usually
requires sophisticated tools. These tools often come with many
whistles and bells, are proprietary or difficult to tinker with,
modify the code and add to it.  Students with access to these tools
end up spending most of the time learning how to press their many
buttons and become technicians instead of professionals. It is the
experience of the author (in a similar field, Electrical Engineering)
that most of these technicians are laid off in their thirties when the
standard recession cycle hits the industry. Their diplomas were not of
much help. Expensive and proprietary software tools have their place
in the industry. Students in their formative years at school should be
able to write code, be able to read the code written by others and
modify, improve and expand it. Code, simulate, debug and correct. This
is the way to develop understanding and intuition"

"Researchers have developed a cheaper and more efficient way to produce
hydrogen from water... [T]he new metal catalyst developed by this team
of researchers uses an alloy made of ruthenium and iridium, so that
both hydrogen and oxygen can be generated at the same time through
accelerating chemical reactions.

The alloy comprises of microscopic crystal sheets measuring just 3
nanometers thick. One nanometer is one-millionth of a millimeter.

Because it is so dense, the crystalline structure can be seen on its
surface, giving it an appearance similar to coral.

Ruthenium is a relatively cheaper material and it accounts for 94
percent of the catalyst’s composition, so the cost of the catalyst’s
metal ingredients can be reduced to a fraction of the cost of using a
combination of platinum and iridium oxide...

The team’s results suggest it is much more efficient than other
conventional methods that use the same voltage. Due to its high
reaction rate, this method can produce around 30 times the amount of
hydrogen, the researchers said"

It stands out bcz I was listening intently, the descr makes a
difference, maybe it is Lowess? Loess? (all legit terms from
Stats). Then I nah, he is just saying "loss" with an accent

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
