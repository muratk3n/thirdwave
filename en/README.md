Not everything needs to be fun, or "visibly fun" as seen from
outside. Electricity is fun and interesting, there are sparks,
current, voltage wooohooo! But it is an inefficient way of delivering
energy.

If we overly focus on the "fun stuff", we are making a pedagogical
mistake, plus might burden / condemn the next generation to
inefficient, bizarre solutions.

Here is what's wrong with the current science - scifi
relationship.. There are many solutions to Einstein's field
equations. There are many interpretations of quantum mechanics. But
out of all possible solutions and interpretations, mov and tv land
chooses the most flashy one, and sadly it chooses the same ones
consistently, that from the outside it looks like that direction is
the new direction of physics.

For example **out of all solutions to Einstein's field equations**,
movies choose the one that will give them wormholes, that way Loki and
Thor can come from Asgard and visit Earth. Or **out of all possible
interpretations of QM** they pick the one that gives them multiple
universes, that way actors can play their doppelganger with a goatee
visiting from a different universe.

"Energy transition is underway at an exceptional level ... Government
of India‚Äôs (GOI) National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHM) initiative
will capitalise on one of the most abundant elements on earth for
cleaner alternative fuel option"

Graeber: "[P]roductive jobs have, just as predicted, been largely
automated away. (Even if you count industrial workers globally,
including the toiling masses in India and China, such workers are
still not nearly so large a percentage of the world population as they
used to be.)

But rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free
the world‚Äôs population to pursue their own projects, pleasures,
visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning not even so much of
the ‚Äúservice‚Äù sector as of the administrative sector, up to and
including the creation of whole new industries like financial services
or telemarketing, or the unprecedented expansion of sectors like
corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources,
and public relations. And these numbers do not even reflect all those
people whose job is to provide administrative, technical, or security
support for these industries, or, for that matter, the whole host of
ancillary industries (dog washers, all-night pizza deliverymen) that
only exist because everyone else is spending so much of their time
working in all the other ones"

At the very least weekly working days need to be reduced down to 4.
Not even during hunter-gathering era, when humans literally had to go
out and physically hunt (and forage) for food, did people work this
much.. Now we have tech up the wazoo, 2% of ppl can feed the entire
population, yet everyone is still running around as if they are
fighting for survival.

The famous [Graeber article](2021/03/bullshit-jobs-article-graeber.md)
that caused much stir back in 2013. Still a good read.

TechCrunch: "Hyzon Motors plans to produce fuel cells, including a
critical component required to power hydrogen vehicles, at two
U.S. factories in a move aimed at kickstarting domestic production at
a commercial scale.

The hydrogen-powered truck and bus manufacturer has already leased a
28,000-square-foot facility in the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook and
plans to expand it by an additional 80,000 square feet"

Dreaming shit up is fine, but done in excess, and repeatedly /
consistently in a certain direction creates an illusion where the
perception of science seen from outside becomes askew.

Lota weirdo funk seems to be the by-product of these field
equations. Its singularities "predict" black holes.. But diff form of
the field equations cld do away with singularities, ie no black holes.

He received the Nobel prize for gravity waves, not "wormholes". Maybe
guy later fell into a post-Nobel funk... who knows..?

Yes yes.. KIP THORNE helped develop the WH visualizations for the
movie *Interstellar*. KIP THORNE.

But that still doesn't mean there is any substance to this "theory".

---

Landau.. you were doing so well.. then I saw the appendix on
visualizing wormholes.. treating this subject as if it is proven
science. Tsck tsck tsck..

I guess the name of this song is 'one way ticket'

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
