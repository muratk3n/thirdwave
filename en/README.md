2014: "In a new online paper ..  the 72-year-old Hawking says, 'There
are no black holes â€” in the sense from which light can't escape to
infinity.'  The U-turn from Hawking, one of the pioneers of modern
black hole theory, surprised his colleagues"

I knew it; *Spectral* and *Outside the Wire* both filmed in Budapest,
Hungary, buildings looked similar.

Key point here; even scientists themselves take lots of knowledge as
given. So scientist who does additional research thinking black holes
exists, has not independently verified it, or questioned if they
exist.. The danger here is you can pile shit upon shit, until stuck
and the whole thing collapses on itself.

CH cannot make a top-notch CPU? That cld be a problem for defense.

Quora: "China does not have any CPU that is not based on Western CPU
designs, sometimes they are simply based on ancient CPU designs. They
simply modify Western designs, put a Chinese part number or sometimes
a Chinese name on it and make all sorts of empty claims about it.

The most modern chip that China got from the West is the ARM CPU
(SoC), which it bragged would be faster that the Qualcomm design of
ARM CPU. What you might not have noticed in all that braggadocio is
that Apple ARM design is 3 to 6 times faster than all Chinese made ARM
variants, so China does not have a high performance ARM CPU, they
simply have an ARM CPU"

"@scientificecon

Deflation is worse than inflation: modest inflation is manageable for
everyone, but deflation happens when nominal GDP shrinks. That means
large numbers of corporate bankruptcies. While the economists rejoice
that things are cheaper for 'consumers', they can't buy as unemployed"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
