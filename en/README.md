It‚Äôs hard to believe in the midst of a six-month lockdown that things
are going to get worse in January. But even Michael Gove seems to be
admitting that Brexit will bring chaos and disruption"

Replenished? HTF? That's crazy!!

"\#Hydrogen for the energy transition: do we have to manufacture it? ...

The native hydrogen [as in dug up from ground, not produced], almost
pure in this case, is directly burned in a suitable gas turbine, and
produces electricity for a small village.¬†Other wells around have been
drilled to try to determine the reserves,¬†within the meaning of¬†oil &
gas, and¬†change the scale.

This success shattered many a priori: many believed that no natural
accumulation of H2 in the subsoil could exist. The initial well has
been producing for 4 years without a drop in pressure, which means it
is continuously recharged.

In addition, surface measurements of the H2 content of soils¬†do not
show any leaks. These were rather expected, because the H2 molecule is
very small and very reactive, and therefore it can easily migrate and
combine with other chemical species"

"Canadian energy company Petroma, led by Malian industrialist Aliou
Boubacar Diallo, discovered the¬†world‚Äôs largest natural hydrogen
deposit 60 kilometres from the Malian capital of Bamako, a find that
has increasingly attracted some of planet‚Äôs most forward-thinking
business leaders interested in clean energy alternatives.

In Bloc 25 covering 43,000 square kilometres, Petroma has affirmed
massive quantities of 95 percent pure natural hydrogen, one of the
most promising new sources needed for a global transition to clean
energy, according to the French scientist Alain Prinzhofer at the
l‚ÄôInstitut de Physique du Globe de Paris.

The company has undertaken the first project to produce electricity
from hydrogen without any C02 emissions"

That makes this bomb 1/15th in effect of the Hiroshima one. An early

I can't believe we are polluting even space.. The movie *Gravity* was
an eye opener on the issue

"@JimBridenstine

The @Space_Station has maneuvered 3 times in 2020 to avoid debris. In
the last 2 weeks, there have been 3 high concern potential
conjunctions. Debris is getting worse! Time for Congress to provide
@CommerceGov with the $15 mil requested by @POTUS for the Office of
Space Commerce"

Pundits can say "this and that is too ideological" to blame, bash
others -- but beware -- even ppl who blame others for having ideology,
have an ideology themselves... Because the absence of ideological
discourse will, automatically, emphasize, indirectly, the *default
ideology* in society, which right now is the Washingon Consensus, post
Berlin-Wall centrism.

It's weird Hasish and others like him are named RINOs. In some ways
they are more Republican than most.

---

That's not why he did it. He, and other pols, might encourage such
talk themselves, which is untrue. They do it to give the 24/7
commentariat something to latch onto.

Hasish's beef is ideological. Ditto for McCain. These people care
deeply about ideology. **It is their job**.

"Gov Hasish went on to speak at Dem Convention bcz he doesn't like Trump's style"

Knowledge organizes, so it reduces entropy, one could say, implies
more order. But new knowledge needs new forms of management, absent
it, can create more disorder.

These are all very speculative thoughts, of course.

Per the weird (likely superfluous) correlation I noticed between my
sci posts and chaos in the ME; I just dropped the m..f..ing bomb up in
this bitch, so we're abt to have World War 3 right abt now, u feel me?

Yes. They can be lied to, convinced on things against their interest,
which all suggest direct democracy, or "polling to decide on policy
direction" style of governence cannot work.

"People were misled by Brexit, does that mean they cannot judge most policies?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
