Showed calculation [before](2020/07/h2-numbers.md#arabia); Replacing
Saudi Arabia'a oil output with solar equiv panels wld need a square
area with 290 km on each side. A big area. Then, at least at first,
renewable fuel generation through fossil + CCS at the source could
help.

F yeah!

Occasionally they anger many, but there is always some action in UK,
some of it even good..

They also talk about CCS

"Project aims to drive UK transition to a low-carbon economy. Essar
plans to supply industry and homes in north-west England after ¬£750m
investment in two plants"

And it would be great to convert that coal into renewable fuel + CCS
before shipping, in the future.

"@JDWilson08

The trade war vs [Australia] goes from bad to worse for China: While
some of its cities face rolling blackouts, Aus has largely offloaded
the coal onto third markets like India, at surprisingly decent
prices. Turns out diversification isn't that hard..."

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
