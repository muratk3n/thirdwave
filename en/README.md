"[W]hat isn't discussed is how Mr. 'Content Is King' got his 'content'
...  [Redstone] bested business rivals throughout his long career as
he engineered deals for Viacom, Paramount and CBS and displayed an
unwavering passion to win. ... Viacom Networks (MTV, BET, Comedy
Central, CMT), the engine that drove Redstone's media empire was
almost entirely built on 'reality', 'live' and 'free' content. Which
is to say, Redstone's genius was finding a way to pipe content made
and paid for by other people (music labels, comedy clubs) on to
cable. And to fill the gap with non-union, unprotected 'perma-lance'
innovation in-house. Reality and music television was just
union-busting. Plain and simple. ... Reality television can seem
exciting and glamorous. Working on reality television, much less
so. As the following stories from "professionally abused" insiders
show, reality TV workers will continue... 'My Super Sweet 16'? A PA
came up with that. 'Jersey Shore'? Just a rip-off of a True Life
pitched by an AP. There was no IP ownership. No health-care. And
Redstone's bet was freelance 20 year olds wouldn't have the stones to
organize or sue"

"But Ginsburg, as Slateâ€™s Mark Joseph Stern has noted, is not the most
liberal Supreme Court justice; that would be the Obama appointee Sonia
Sotomayor. In recent years Ginsburg has voted with the majority in
favor of the fossil-fuel industry and against criminal defendants and
asylum seekers"

"Democrats from all corners of the party appeared largely united behind
Joe Bidenâ€™s selection of the California senatorÂ Kamala HarrisÂ as his
running mate on Tuesday ... praise also came from high-profile
progressive leaders on Tuesday, including two of Bidenâ€™s other former
rivals, the senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren"

Wait.. I thought expertise had gone by the wayside, it's like
technocratic or something.. 

"Brian Lee Hitchens, a Florida taxi driver ... who prayed in the
morning before going shopping or carrying passengers without a mask,
was sure that nothing would happen to him and his asthma-sick
wife. God would take care of him. And possibly the entire corona hype
is mere hysteria anyway, as could be read on the Internet, and the
virus is no more dangerous than ordinary flu. Then he fell ill
himself, then his wife, who struggled for weeks to survive. While
still in the hospital, Brian Lee Hitchens wrote on Facebook about his
change of heart. The virus is not a fake, the pandemic is real. It is
important to heed 'the advice of experts'"

Networks are probably pleased, Kamala can dish it out, do some drama.

In general Californians are good to have in any cabinet. There is some
culture around green energy in the state, as they've been
experimenting with a few technologies before everyone else.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
