Hmm..  The cables are woven by hand, there are screws, other
connections too..  If the whole thing, metal + plastic was printed
together in one shot, then it'd be truly 3D printed.

It's a start tho..

Need to be picky with words like "Americans want". I'd change it to
".. would probably like, after they had, and might reward us for".

I understand campaigning for office can dilute language tho.

In one *The Expanse* ep they had a "Martian colonist" come to Earth
and walk around. An Earth character makes fun of how she walks,
feeling heavier weight due to different g. In reality she'd probably
have died on Mars due to bone degradation. And if she ever came back
to Earth she'd be crushed by mere gravity.

"@BreeNewsome

Folks are just wildly claiming 'defund the police' had an impact on
the election when:

1) Biden campaigned on giving *more* funding to police

2) it wasn’t a measure that was supported by the candidates whose campaigns lost

3) no one is providing any data to support the claim

lol"

DJT should take a page out of Turktiggerstan handbook; blame the
son-in-law for everything and cleanse yourself of all ills.

Too late for the election of course. Loss for DJT. Sad.

I have voted Republican most of my life. I consider myself a
conservative. I want to believe there are still 'very fine' people on
both sides of the aisle but...if #GOP leaders don’t get their
collective noses out of that man’s ass, we’re gonna have words"

Just kidding. It's fine.

This is buuul-shit. Weakly typed language binness ?!

C++ has mellowed!

What's next? String to integer conversion?

Wut?

```
for (const auto & [ key, value ] : map) {
	cout << key << std::endl;
}
```

Wut?

CONST AUTO?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
