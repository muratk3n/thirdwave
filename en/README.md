This is how important the legal system is. I bet UEA set up this
English based seperate court system to pull in visitors, investment.

"[UAE] DIFC Courts began operations in 2006 and was established to
manage cases relating to companies licensed by the Dubai International
Financial Centre (DIFC) Free Zone. DIFC Courts is an English language
court based on those operating within the UK‚Äôs common law
system. Originally set up to manage cases for DIFC companies only,
today any company in the UAE can opt-in to use DIFC Courts for legal
matters; all that is required is a clause in a new contract or an
amendment to an existing one. Differing to onshore courts, DIFC Courts
hears cases in English"

"@AJentleson

President Biden & Democratic leaders deserve tremendous credit for not
letting the Collins gang water down the aid package. Hard to overstate
what a watershed that could be. It was never a foregone conclusion &
sticking to their guns took a lot of guts. Now lets play it forward"

Replying to @OliviaMesser

I experienced something similar at the beginning of a period of being
uninsured. CVS wanted to charge 750D for a month's supply of a
medication. Thankfully I didn't pay, and I quickly learned that
Walmart sold it for $25. Mom and pop pharmacies are usually good about
this too"

"@OliviaMesser

Sans insurance for a few days bc paperwork issue. Pharmacy charged me
$500 for a month‚Äôs worth of medicine I *have* to take. With GoodRX the
same pharmacy would fill the same amount for 13ish. I HATE this. WHICH
IS IT?? If it‚Äôs not worth $500, WHY are you asking me to pay that

This country‚Äôs healthcare system is so broken, and sometimes you‚Äôre
randomly presented with irrefutable and absurd evidence of how
arbitrary the dollar amounts assigned to meds and services are. It
makes me want to scream"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
