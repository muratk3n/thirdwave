The book I was writing when our Brazil source upended my life with
that huge archive last year was how the War on Terror is being brought
home to militarize society (mostly to squash uprisings over growing
wealth inequality). Still writing it. This month alone is a chapter"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
