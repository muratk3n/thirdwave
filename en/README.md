Post Trump tax reform, the United States collects less corporate
income tax revenue (as a fraction of GDP) than all other OECD
countries. Even Hungary, with its 9% tax rate, does better than the
US...

This matters because, fundamentally, the corporate tax is a minimum
tax for the very rich. Bezos, Buffett, Zuckerberg, etc can avoid the
individual income tax by asking their companies not to pay
dividends. But they still have to pay the corporate tax

Except now it's almost gone"

CJR: "As discussions on how to help save local news continue, new
bills and ideas have come to the fore. Independent newspapers are
coalescing around the Local Journalism Sustainability Act which
proposes direct subsidies (in the form of tax credits) for news
subscribers, local journalists and small business advertisers. Sweden
has a similar news subsidy system.

Large media outlets are backing the Journalism Competition and
Preservation Act which will allow outlets to band together to
negotiate with Google and Facebook. In some ways this is like
Australiaâ€™s recent News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory
Bargaining Code"

Yea thats f...d up. They destroyed that guy jus bcz he was successful
against them in the court of law.

Jacobin: "When human rights lawyer Steven Donziger won a
multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the oil giant Chevron, the company
retaliated by setting out to destroy Donzigerâ€™s life. Now in his
twentieth month of house arrest on the orders of a Chevron-linked
judge, his Kafkaesque story is a window into the corrupt and
corporate-captured US legal system"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
