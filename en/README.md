"Nicolas [Brahy] will join the hydrogen infrastructure fund initiative
...which intends to play a critical role in the context of the
European Green Deal and the climate activities of the European
Union. Many Member States have already earmarked more than 45 billion
Euros in their respective national hydrogen strategies. Public funding
will need to be blended with private investment in order to guarantee
long term market structures. Nicolas is perfectly suited to boost the
investment activities and will integrate his broad knowledge into the
acceleration of hydrogen development"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
