"Data scientists" learn about the vector dot product as a "distance
measure", bcz their vectors are usually "features" i.e. customer, with
age, height, etc values on it, and if already normalized they can get
$\cos\theta = v_1 \cdot v_2 $, no need to $\arccos$ just use it as a
raw measure between -1 and +1.

But I bet nearly half of them dont know dot product can be seen as
projection. Sad.

requires clean H2 as feedstock. EU made the right bet.

So hitting page down does not scroll web page down anymore? Thank
you. Who thought up this feature?

That's right -- command line, as in textual input is much more
expressive than visual clickety click.

One word is worth thousands of pictures.

"The command line remains so incredibly popular because it‚Äôs so
incredibly versatile.

You can do a lot in a terminal. You can manage your OS, apps and
files; you can connect to remote servers, watch movies, play games,
fetch the weather forecast, and a whole heap more"

turned all Russian peasants, 80% of the population, into serfs ‚Äì

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
