One country / continent with 219,000 TWh of annual potential. That is
just insane.

It's great!

According to IEA world energy consumption for 2013 was estimated to be
157,481 Terrawatt hours. In one year Oz can produce

```python
print ((25000 * 24 * 365) / 1000, 'TWh')
```

```text
219000.0 TWh
```

.. meaning single-handedly Oz could produce *more* energy required for
the entire world, using completely renewable resources ðŸ˜¶

Is this serious? That number is crazy.. 

"Australia receives more sunlight per square meter than just about any
other country. Its south and west coasts are also buffeted by powerful
winds. Overall, the country boasts a renewable energy potential of
25,000 gigawatts"

It can be stored at room temparature, major advantage

"Research also indicates that the energy density by volume of ammonia
is nearly double that of liquid hydrogen, its primary competitor as a
green alternative fuel. Ammonia is also much easier to ship and
distribute"

"In 2018, Douglas MacFarlane, a professor of chemistry atÂ Monash
UniversityÂ in Australia, developed fuel cells that canÂ transform
renewable electricity into ammonia... MacFarlaneâ€™s fuel cells operate
in reverse, making carbon-free fuel from electricity

'This is breathing nitrogen in and breathing ammonia out,' said
MacFarlane, showing his fuel cell. It is almost the size of a hockey
puck and clad in stainless steel. Two plastic tubes on the cellâ€™s
backside feed it nitrogen gas and water. It has a power cord for
electricity and a third tube on the front that silently exhales
ammonia"

Van Wilder knows how to party!

I would expect nothing less from a company founded by ADOLF HITLER

This guy is talking out of his ass..

"VW CEO says fuel cell cars 'not the answer'"

Class is weird in UK. Actor Dominic West, from Jimmy "Fuckin" McNulty
fame, in *The Wire*, says when he met one director and he first looked
at him he commented "posh". As in he labeled him as posh. Funny thing
is West mostly played working class roles in his career.

Posh not posh.. who decides these things.. Just by the look it's done?

Damian Lewis would be.. posh?

Jason Statham? Not posh.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
