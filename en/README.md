Pay attention to this talk of criminalizing encryption in the
UK. Expect a similar playbook where you live: A fundamental threat to
a functioning digital infrastructure getting buried in rhetoric and
hustled along the lawmaking path without the enormous public debate it
warrants"

"42,000 ...  people in the Brazilian town of Marica receiving mumbucas
â€“ a virtual currency created by the oil-wealthy seaside town prior to
the pandemic as a form of universal basic income (UBI). Mumbacas and
other measures designed to bolster Maricaâ€™s social safety net have
made the socialist town a standout success story during the pandemic,
as Al Jazeeraâ€™s Monica Yanakiew reports, while most of Brazil battles
the virus, which has cost at least 400,000 lives and thrown more than
25 million into poverty"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
