Offline synch of components / people / work is the way to go 

Toffler, R. Wealth: "Early industrial economies operated under
completely different temporal conditions. Assembly-line work required
a different rhythm. Thus, the factory whistle and the time clock were
invented to coordinate work schedules.  By contrast, today, ...  the
uses of time are becoming increasingly personalized and irregular, if
not erratic. More different tasks need to be integrated, and the
acceleration effect truncates the time available for each task. All
this makes synchronization harder to achieve"

Made a PR on Github, it got merged, after brief discussion on it on
GH, all async, I dont know where this person is, but it all came
together splendidly. All sync'd and his physim repo has new code.

```python
r = 1.7  # km
circumference = 2*np.pi*r
"%0.2f km/h" % (circumference * 60.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '640.88 km/h'
```

This speed is attainable. BTW once it gets going it will take less
energy to keep it in that speed.

Good news is it'll probably take less energy for that spin than on
Earth

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
