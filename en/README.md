"Electrolyser project sizes are scaling up very quickly too as the
technology and supply chain matures: to date most projects have been
between 1-10 MWs. By 2025 a typical project will be 100-500 MWs.. By
2030, typical projects are expected to scale up further to 1 GW+, with
the emergence of large-scale hydrogen export projects, deployed in
countries benefiting from cheap electricity"

Jacobin: "Israel Created the Refugees in Gaza That They’re Now Bombing"

---

Jacobin: "Last week, CNN interviewed [someone in] Jerusalem — almost
certainly the first time a Palestinian resisting dispossession was

the young Palestinian swiftly challenged decades of malicious
portrayals of the Palestinian struggle in mainstream media"

Fauci fukked up twice. Trump by being the chaos agent that he was. CH
too for acting like the Thirld World gov most know they really
are.. To borrow a 2016 term - sad.

---

Scenario: Fauci funded bunch of research whose job was to preempively
supercharge viruses to see destructive potential. Program was stopped
during Bam admin, restarted during the DJT WH chaos (when the cat is
away the mice will play) by AF.. They outsourced some of the work to a
Chinese lab with questionable standards.. *Engineered* virus
leaked. When CCP saw shit hitting the fan among their population maybe
they suspected conspiracy against them so they did not shut air travel
to get back to 'the West'. Fast forward, 3 million dead.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
