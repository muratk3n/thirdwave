C++ truly is fast as shit. It's just f-ing raw speed. Close to the metal.

A million particles in a simulation. An early code had >4000 but with
an inefficient O(N^2) which tells me in O(1) setting, that frees up
proc, ~1 Million cld be fine.

Biden was a good candidate. The incumbent was deeply unpopular, and
the election rested mostly on his delivery, but the Biden campaign
provided the ultimate opposite, neutralized the other side's strengths
well.

"A slew of moderate lawmakers, whose wins in the 2018 midterms handed
the gavel again to Pelosi, have lost or are on track to lose their
seats. Meanwhile, several establishment Democrats are set to be
replaced by staunch progressives, shifting Democrats’ political center
of gravity further left in the lower chamber of Congress"

Can we tie (representative) democracy status (a score between 0-10) to
trade barriers -- more democracy gets more trade.

---

Haha DETO instead of NATO? Democratic Earth Treaty Organization. Only
democracies are allowed, members face dismissal if they backtrack on
democracy. Unified defense, increased trade, etc.

They use hair to clean oil spills

"There's a good reason hair gets oily. It's because your hair follicles
have little fat glands that ooze oil onto your hair... Well, now
scientists in Australia have taken a cue from nature to see how well
hair and fur can absorb a different kind of oil - crude oil"

On the face of it, looks fine.. More friends for Israel is a good
thing (I do want them to exist, as a democracy). But how'bout the
backdrop? If ripping up an existing peace deal caused the hostility in
the first place, then is lining up bunch of allies behind Israel
simply a patch up? Wld US also strategically prefer an ME Cold War, or
have everyone be in a concillatory / neutral state to both itself,
Israel and eachother? Cant just do out-of-the-ordinary for the fuck of
it, or just for tactics. There needs to be some strategic sense to it all.

"But isn't an outsider like Trump a good thing bcz he did the untried,
Israel is now being recognized by many new Arab states"

Third Wave tech is overwhelming Second Wave institutions. IMO to
provide some sort of sanity before the ultimate shift, we need to cut
off the extra noise, work extra hard to do that, otherwise the central
institutions will be bombarded. They will do no good anyway --
remember my earlier example, Newt sitting in front of a
chatroom. Trolls bombarding the singular Speaker provides nothing.

---

I am starting to think even the smallest direct-democracy practices
need to be removed, along with referandums (which need to be banned),
turning the whole process to go through representatives. Remember the
California recall election? And the circus afterwards..?

---

Dont put voters on the spot for issues. Get elected somehow, enact
policy, be reelected on their success.

---

Progs probably did not like that outcome. 

"Californians overwhelmingly voted in favour of Prop 22, exempting
app-based ride-hailing and delivery services from classifying drivers
as employees eligible for benefits and job protections"

"@gabrielazanfir

For us [at EFF], Prop 24 [allows consumers to prevent businesses from
sharing personal information, etc] is rather a mixed bag of partial
steps backwards and forwards.

I have never seen any technology which enjoys such universal support

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
