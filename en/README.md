Resillience is part of good tech, yes. Imagine having an electric
rifle and the shit runs out of battery in the middle of the battle..
That rifle would not be high tech, it'd just be dumb tech.

"French army chief of staff: 'We should therefore not get caught up in
very high technology. Our weapon systems must always be relatively
resilient and stable and ... they must be able to operate in degraded
mode'"

Sure the Sun is hotter than lava, but not a million times hotter. It's
only five times hotter.

---

Easy to intuit the Sun is liquid. What is the hottest natural thing we
know on Earth? It is lava. And lava is liquid, it flows. We know
this. So why do some so readily accept the gaseous hyphothsis?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
