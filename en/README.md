HyTime. Great name. As in "it's HyTime we switch to renewable fuels  .. "

"With between 20-45% of the diesel fuel being displaced by green
hydrogen on the various vehicles, the HyTIME project concluded that
with the appropriate hydrogen infrastructure, fleet wide roll-out
could provide a huge and timely step change in overall fleet
emissions"

\#disruptTheGrid

Let's do this. The grid is inefficient as hell. De-electrification is needed.

"I'm most interested in seeing how Bloom Energy can potentially solve
two problems at once with a new strategy. The company recently
announced a new solid oxide electrolyzer that it expects to have
available in 2021. In its simplest form, an electrolyzer simply uses
energy (usually electricity) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen
atoms. It's the reverse of the chemical reaction that takes place in a
fuel cell.

The reason electrolyzers are important for energy is that -- if
they're cost-effective -- they could essentially make fossil fuels
obsolete by creating clean, abundant fuel. Water is abundant, and
there's more than enough wind and solar energy to replace all fossil
fuels, so clean energy isn't a problem either. Bloom Energy plans to
use this fuel for its backup markets, but it could also be used in
large ships currently being developed by Samsung Heavy Industries and
Bloom Energy. This could disrupt shipping as well as the grid"

"@ericuman

For decades, NY has kept cops‚Äô records secret. You couldn‚Äôt know an
officer‚Äôs history, or even they‚Äôve been displined. Police unions have
gotten a judge to stop NYC from releasing most of the docs But we have
the records too. And now, so do you"

*The Atlantic*: "The U.S. and China both offer different social and
governance models‚Äîone is generally free and open and the other is
authoritarian and closed. Each threatens the other, not necessarily
because of the foreign-policy choices the leaders make, but because of
what the governments are at their core. Beijing believes that the
freedom of the press, the internet, social media, NGOs, economic
interdependence, and exchange programs all have the potential to
undermine their regime. They are not wrong. Indeed, many Americans saw
this as a positive side effect of engagement. Many Americans rightly
understand that China‚Äôs authoritarian model has negative externalities
that threaten U.S. interests and freedoms. Tools of repression
domestically find their way overseas. Beijing seeks to censor all
criticism of its regime by coercing other governments, companies, and
individuals. It sucks up data on foreign citizens. It employs
mercantilist techniques to pursue dominance of new technologies. China
is actively seeking to eviscerate liberal norms around human rights,
anti-corruption, and freedom of speech. The regime interferes in
democracies to advance its interests. Neither side can accommodate the
other without compromising the essence of its system"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
