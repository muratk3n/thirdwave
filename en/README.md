"GenCell Energy, GNCL (TASE), a leading Israel-based manufacturer of
fuel cell energy solutions, today announces the successful completion
of the design and synthesis of a catalyst that is not based on noble
metals (palladium) and as such provides an economical substitute for
these materials. The process by which the new catalyst accelerates
chemical reactions that are necessary to generate clean electricity
via electrochemical reaction inside the fuel cell is identical to the
process using a catalyst based on noble metals"

We encourage certain biz behaviours all the time.. There is food
safety, regulations.. We already punish prods that might *kill you*
over others who dont.

We can encourage 'recyclable capitalism' by rewarding comps whose
output is more recyclable. How? Look at the "garbage stats"... Find
out whose products generate most single-use plastic, other
hard-to-recycle items in the garbage plants, tax their ass.

Wall Street was relieved when @SenWarren was passed over for Treasury

allies to run his government"

45 psi is 3 bars? Regular air outside is 1 bar, so take air, reduce
its volume by 1/3 (bcz $PV = nRT)$, that is enough pressure for a good
mechanic push.

We know thats doable of course from break-barrel airguns, some use
compressed gas.

He is clearly into fuels, so wld be into an H2 based econ (didnt
Mercedes give him a fuel-cell car?)

"Kretschmann has mass appeal in Germany's conservative south and is
more popular there than the party he represents. An opinion poll by
German public broadcaster ZDF in February showed that while 30.3
percent of the electorate polled in Baden-W√ºrttemberg planned to vote
for the Greens, 70 percent wanted Kretschmann as state premier.. He is
a committed environmentalist and social liberal, but talks openly
about his diesel-fueled car"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
