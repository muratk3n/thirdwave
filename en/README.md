THE VAMPIRE SQUID WOULD KNOW

10 TRILLION EUROS

"Calling it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Goldman Sachs estimates
the addressable market [of H2] could be worth â‚¬10 trillion ($11.7
trillion) by 2050, split between Asia, the U.S. and Europe"

---

[I]t looks like the future [with H2] has arrived as seven of the
biggest green hydrogen project developers come together to launch the
Green Hydrogen Catapult Initiative in a bid to increase the production
of green hydrogen 50-fold in the next six years.

Finally got the working code, research papers, tech, all lined up for
next step.. Direction choice, lining up resources are the hardest
part.  Wasting time bad.. every shot needs to count.

And [this](2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.md#australia) is why Oz is
friendly with a naval power, first Britain, than US. Gets naval help,
provides soldiers to fight for that power.

Then, if someone is hitting at that help, is hitting at that
relationship, see the China-Oz row over the artificial Afganistan
photo.

Otto loss during WWI? Also [inevitable](2015/03/gallipoli.md). A few
good defense, at Gallipoli for instance, changed nothing.

---

Germany - Otto alliance during WWI? An act of
[desparation](2020/08/germany-otto-alliance.md), nothing
ideological. It was inevitable.

---

Time to dissect.. really like dissecting, seeing how all parts work

---

Force of habit from biz programming days.. keeping dependencies as
minimal as possible. Even my most demo-ready number crunching code
wont depend on UI, I dump select shots during simulation as png.  Then
I'll show the ImageMagick to piece the GIF together from invid shots
to the user. All kept short, to the point.

Man getting that VNC to work was tough business

Looking at religious [make-up](2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.md#religion)
is demonstrative.

Migrant quickly assimilates in a gen, so bunch of ragged punks from
"Central Asia" certainly did not create culture in today's
Anatolia. They were assimilated. Gone. Forget these fairy tales of
wolves, some f-ing mountain, with a crack through it or whatever fuck,
these niggers are no different from any culture that came and went
before them. The fairy tales are escapism.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
