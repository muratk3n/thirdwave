HEP is recommended by Gianotti, Giudice..? You know the goombah are
just looking for another New Jersey, that one-step away place to move
to and never to move from again.. They got no experimentation. They
gon sit on their ass and eat ziti all day long, that's what they want.

The same problem keeps showing up again and again. Flailing in a
random direction is confused with "courage", "experimentation", or
"being adventerous". You gotta choose in which direction to shoot,
being mindful of ammo. Some trials are more promising than others.

"While HEP [high energy physics, colliders] experiment is facing
difficult times because of fundamental physical, engineering and
economic limits, the problems of HEP theory are mostly
self-inflicted. The decision nearly 40 years ago by a large fraction
of the field to orient their research programs around bad ideas that
don’t work (SUSY extensions of the Standard Model and string theory
unification), then spend decades refusing to acknowledge failure is at
the core of the sad state of the subject these days ..

About the canniest and most influential HEP theorist around is Nima
Arkani-Hamed, and a few days ago I watched an interview of him by
Janna Levin. On the question of the justification for a new collider,
he’s careful to state that the justification is mainly the study of
the Higgs. He’s well aware that the failure of the 'naturalness'
arguments for weak-scale SUSY needs to be acknowledged and does so. He
also is well aware that any attempt to argue this failure away by
saying 'we just need a higher energy collider' won’t pass the laugh
test ...

The most disturbing aspect of the interview is that Levin devotes a
lot of time (and computer graphics) to getting Arkani-Hamed to explain
his 1998 ideas about 'large extra dimensions', repeatedly telling the
audience that he has been given a $3 million prize for them. ... 

At the time it was pretty strange that a $3 million dollar prize was
being given for ideas that weren’t working out. It’s truly bizarre
though that Levin would now want to make such failed ideas the
centerpiece of a presentation to the public, misleading people about
their status. ...

This is part of the overall weird situation of the failed ideas
(SUSY/strings) of 40 years ago: they still live on in a dominant
position when the subject is presented to the public"

Particle Physicists Continue Empty Promises

If it was, it was misguided. EU is not on the opposite side of the
world, it is UK's next door neighbor with existing trade over a
trillion $ annually.

The CANZUK idea is more globalization-inspired than EU relation ever
could be.. No wonder it is sold as part of "global Britain". It is
ironic an anti-globalization movement flirting with
globalization. Maybe it's just abt ppl missing the days when Britain
was tearing shit up overseas. Good times. But those days are gone, right?

Why not experiment with new ideas like floating cities, instead of
reliving old ones? On international waters, anyone can create such
structures, and they would spur lots of innovation.

"Was Brexit abt being against globalization?"

"@scottdetrow

[On] Pennsylvania and fracking. There are a LOT of things us national
reporters are oversimplifying and dumbing down here. ...  Fracking –
more accurately the energy economy that has sprung up around it -- has
been a real boost to the state, particularly Western Pa. Pittsburgh
has become a Houstoneque energy hub.

It’s always been controversial and many Pennsylvanians have been
skeptical – particularly in the vote-rich eastern half of the
state. And as both Dem and GOP governors underregulated, voters wanted
more scrutiny. While money poured in some places, other communities were very
underwhelmed by the promises vs the reality. 

There have been environmental red flags from day 1.  ... this is not
longer the fast-booming energy economy it was a decade ago. Thousands
of wells have been drilled, and energy prices have dropped. Both have
led to a relative slowdown. Voters aren’t as obsessed as GOP thinks
they are"

"Ardica specializes in the production of Alane, a highly stable,
extremely lightweight hydrogen powder now used by a select set of
customers in industrial and military applications. The U.S. Army has
been working closely with Ardica for many years to test Alane’s
superior ability to power a wide range of mobile and vehicular
applications. By replacing traditional batteries, Alane greatly
reduces weight and extends operations while increasing the safety and
efficiency of the soldiers.

The U.S. Army chose Alane because it can be stored, shipped, stocked,
and accessed easily. Alane does not lose its energy potential over
time and is unaffected by temperature variations. It does not require
massive capital investment to develop new infrastructure, and can be
recycled and regenerated"

Yea.. Spain should get rid of its monarchy. Great idea. Go for it.

What pisses me off? The guy learning a topic from my tutorials after I
shat bricks collating info for that tutorial.

Just kidding.. it's okay.

Yep.. [this post](2019/08/manganese-hydride.md) reminded me, Manganese
Hydride-1, then I saw a company is working on it -

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
