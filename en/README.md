"Kenworth became the first company to reach the summit of Pikes Peak
with a Class 8 fuel cell electric vehicle. The milestone occurred
during a Kenworth T680 FCEV zero emissions performance demonstration"

Constants are key, and IMO physics should be taught through them,
i.e. how each is derived / measured, and each lecture builds towards
one, in succession. This connects with earlier idea of teaching
concepts as its founders discovered them.

Right.. electronics uses QM but q tunneling needed for it was already
discovered 1928.

I knew things were bad, but only bad since 70s. This guy says it's
been bad since 30s.

Alex Unzicker: "I don't know how many of you believe that the Higgs
boson was the discovery of the century but what is sure that Einstein,
Dirac, or Schrodinger would have considered this discovery as
ridiculous they would never have believed that such a model with so
many unexplained parameters reflecting anything fundamental.

So I'm going to argue that particle physics as practice since 1930 is
a futile enterprise in its entirety. ...

First of all good physics is simple, and the true revolutions in
physics always simplify the laws of nature. Maxwell's electrodynamics
was a revolution because the electrodynamic constants and the speed of
light were condensed in one formula, eliminating one constant of
nature.  So did the Planck constant h simplify the laws of nature and
Newton's Theory of Gravitation condensed dozens of unexplained
parameters into one gravitational constant.

[Today's] particle physics is going the other way around. It produced
[too many free] parameters"

The vaccine rollout is so typical of this country's approach to
delivering public goods. A decentralized and underfunded patchwork of
organizations tasked with moving mountains by a federal government
motivated primarily by a fanatical fear of the wrong people receiving
benefit

The result: A system ripe for bad faith grift and line-cutting by the
wealthy and powerful that fails to deliver promised benefits at twice
the necessary expense, thereby undercutting public faith in the
program and leading to further decentralization and stigmatization.

It's far from an original insight, but I keep being struck by how much
more humane and effective our public programs would be if they were
motivated by a fear of people who need them *not* receiving services
rather than people who don't getting something by mistake"

Policy needs to be celeb-indifferent, pursued by capable people. LBJ
knew his shit, came up with the Moon landing idea, funded it while in
office, so US went to the Moon.

*Red Planet*, 2000, must be Tesla monkey boy's formative film. I think
the f-ing moron had his entire worldview shaped by this one thing. It
shows Mars with atmosphere (not possible), talks of plans with ppl
living there (ur bones would fall off after long-term exposure), there
is even a killer AI (hyperbole). But if you were 11, you could believe
it, and with media being what it is, get all kinds of attention and
money peddling this "vision".

I wonder how many people subserviently cheering Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook
and Google billionaires for destroying Parler a) have ever been on
Parler, b) know anything about it besides what CNN & NBC censors have
shown them, & c) compared the hate speech there to what's on FB &
YouTube"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
