NYT (12/22/2020): "To help Pfizer, the deal calls for the government
to invoke the Defense Production Act to give the company better access
to roughly nine specialized products it needs to make the vaccine. One
person familiar with the list said it included lipids, the oily
molecules in which the genetic material that is used in both the
Moderna and Pfizer vaccines is encased"

@sidhant

"United States first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and
effective and, so far, successful effort to vaccinate the American
people", US State Dept when asked about #COVID vaccine raw materials

Sci achieved much but there are still holes in the grand knowledge,
on some fundamental questions.

Frankly it was a bit surprising at first seeing sci folk still do not
know why planes fly. But then u think about misconceptions around
black holes, the big-bang, gasesous sun, then you are like 'yeah that
cld fall through the cracks no problem'

It is encouraging in some ways in that there is much to do.

The 90s-2010s period was spent on "barbarians at the gates"
narrative..  this narrative was excessive. Old Guard is still there,
carries some influence.. Notice "the Internet Guy" Bezos bought WaPo
joining the guard, rather than start his own thing doing "dhat
disrupting binness".

SSt cld provide a springboard to new outlets, those outlets need to
grow institutional muscle tho to compete

Slate: "Substack today has somewhere north of 500,000 paid
subscribers, which represents a meteoric growth rate but is still just
a fraction of, say, the New York Timesâ€™ 7.5 million... A key to
understanding Substackâ€™s impact on the news is to recognize that the
kind of journalism that tends to thrive thereâ€”so far, at least for the
most partâ€”is not actually news. Itâ€™s commentary and analysis, aimed at
the chattering classes"

Mostly, yes. Making diverse set of products is what contributes to
innovation, as Hidalgo [found](2017/08/production-gdp-globalization.md).
Whether from that angle, or from my greater-sum angle, the conclusion is the same.

"But then should everyone be able to produce everything?"

But.. but.. we are globalized and shit, travel freedom earth is flat

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
