Quick doomsday check, checking if any spikes in earthquakes globally, as time series.

No upward trend. Signal looks mean-reverting

```python
import pandas as pd
from quakefeeds import QuakeFeed
feed = QuakeFeed("4.5", "month")
m = [[feed[i]['properties']['time'], feed[i]['properties']['mag']] for i in range(len(feed))]
df = pd.DataFrame(m).sort_values(by=0)
mags = df[1].rolling(window=15).mean()
mags.plot()
plt.title('Monthly Earthquakes')
plt.savefig('quake-series.png')
```

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
