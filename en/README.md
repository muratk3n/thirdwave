I realized there are some gems about "policy vs crass pollster" angle
in George Stepahanapopopolloolololopopopooloopopous book All Too
Human. See the fights against the rabid pollster Dick Morris.

BTW eff polls, most are not trustworthy. Trust what ppl do with their vote.

They r idiots.. what else is new? (but representative democracy still works).

Glad I finally watched Tenet so I can leave it in 2020 with all the other bad stuff"

Critics are short-changing *Kong: Skull Island*. We can't expect to see
an exact remake of the original King Kong everytime. They got a fem
lead kinda looking like Jessica Lange but not exactly the same? WTH?

This movie is about war mongering. Better mov also IMO. The humans go
to an island accompanied by a military escort who is headed by a
colonel unhappy the Vietnam War ended (1973). He carries the war with
him to the island. Roles reversed now, the big ape is defending (kinda
like the Vietnamese were defending their home turf?), where the humans
are invading. And the enemy this time was something far worse.

It is subjectively important bcz ppl subjectively do "emotional accounting" at year level.. and since many ppl do it, tho subjective it may be, it makes the turn of the year objectively important.

But I appreciate the subversion of expectations, the quicky-contra ðŸ˜‰

Then if Senate leadership is not codified in law, I guess party
discipline is playing a role in keeping everyone in line? People
follow the precedent (and the leader) bcz they dont want to incur the
party's wrath. But the leader also has to watch his coalition, he
couldn't just willy nilly do stuff, bring anything for a vote.. He
himself is also elected by his party members.

"Under the rules, all senators are essentially equal. That is, no
senator is more powerful than another. However, the majority leader is
clearly considered to be the most powerful senator today. This
perception is based on his ability to make motions to proceed to
legislation and nominations and to fill the so-called amendment tree
(i.e. offer the maximum allowable number of amendments to legislation
to block senators from offering their own amendments). Both are based
on his ability to be recognized first by the Senateâ€™s Presiding
Officer. But the leaderâ€™s preferential recognition and, by extension,
his ability to make motions to proceed to bills and nominees and his
ability to fill the amendment tree, are grounded only in
precedent. And the leaderâ€™s power in these areas is perpetuated simply
by senatorsâ€™ continued deference to the majority leader to wield them
however he chooses"

Trade if you must, buy if you need, but nothing beats highly localized
networks which have dense interlocking know-how. This is why advanced
countries are advanced. Pfizer develops drug with cooperation, but
they are at the center of that cooperation and they are based in
Germany. The cooperation part is secondary, and moot.

Of course they are. Both are major exporters.

"China and Germany are pro-globalization"

He is powerful bcz other Senators defer to him. This power doesnt seem to be based on anything legally binding.

"McConnell is powerful. He blocks everything"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
