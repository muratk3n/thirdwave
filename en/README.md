Beckley: "Yes history has shown that technological revolutions create
prosperity *in the long run* but every single time one of these things
has happened they have forced some workers into lower wage jobs or
into unemployment in the short run, and the short run can actually
last an entire lifetime. So if you study the industrial revolution you
know the one of the biggest technological revolutions, for the first
70 years of the industrial revolution in the Great Britain from 1770
to 1840, average wages actually stagnated, and living standards
declined.  The average height of men actually shrunk because they had
less nutrition over that 70 years, even as output per worker expanded
by nearly 50 percent, that's because the gains from mass mechanization
during that time were largely captured by business elites...

There could be a world where you would have sluggish growth, lots of
debt, stagnant wages, for at least a big part of the population, and
extreme inequality. If you had that kind of economic world that of
course would breed nationalism and extremism"

Providing "gonzo Internet" to Cuba.. good idea.

I am not entirely convinced Cuban regime wants the ambargo to end..
Why would they? It is the perfect scapegoat. 

This observation was made by some during 90s for Fidel, it'd made
sense to me.

which very likely hurt Al Gore and later Hilary respectively in Florida.

There are a boat load of examples where a Dem was screwed bcz of
Cuba..  You could claim Clinton lost gov in 1980 partly bcz of
Castro. Cuba sent refugees to US, Carter dumped them on Arkansas,
there was a ruckus, Cubans escaped from camp and armed citizens nearly
shot them to death. Some other factors were there 2, but the refugee
issue loomed large, all thanks to Castro.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
