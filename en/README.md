Growing up, my father told me, donâ€™t beg for your rights, you
organize, and you take them. So, to the young people fighting in this
movement for change, here is my charge: march in the streets, protest,
run for school committee or city council or the state legislature. And
win"

Slapping on new tech on old structure with ineffective results but
making it look shiny that you can technobabble about... This will be
centrist Walhalla.

OVER YET?'"

Good good..

Future relationship with China might not be too profitable either,
makes sense from that angle.. As long as CH was "favored" they could
earn dollars they could pay others with. With that reduced, future looks
iffy. Noone wants monopoly money. And dont try to back curr "with
gold", the stupidest f-ing scheme ever. People will clap and scream
"new world order" but behind the scenes they will say "give me my
dollars bitch!".

"Germany has announced a new blueprint for relations with Asia, calling
in particular for 'diversity' in its focus in the region"

A lot of them lived through 60/70s, which were not silent times, but
US still had some pizzazz, hadn't sold its soul yet.

Then it became Brasil -- thanks to centrist Dems.

"@cwarzel

increasingly having this a convo this summer that leads to the same
scary place: the vast majority of those in power right now grew up
during a golden age of relative social/political stability and believe
that stability is the norm and thus are deeply unprepared for this
moment"

When we first talked about virtual education and inequality, I was
imagining some kids at the kitchen table while others struggled to
find a quiet place and wifi. It did not occur to me that the
privileged kids would have ENTIRE ACTUAL REAL CLASSROOMS built in
their homes"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
