"@APPEALtd

@Shell_Australia says @APPEACONFERENCE that green hydrogen is going to
take time, scale, and needs to dramatically reduce in cost. Blue
hydrogen can assist by creating demand earlier at a better price point
to get people used to using hydrogen first. #auspol"

Hey this is great. Instead of that Roman corksucking Otto-flavored
peasant Islam, DE can do a better job grooming these people.

"Imams Made in Germany Imams â€” trained in Germany and in the German
language â€” has been a long time coming.. At last year's German Islam
Conference, he called plans for the college good news for Muslims in
Germany as well as the country overall, which has taken pains to
reduce the influence of foreign-trained imams, especially from Turkey"

30s nationalism was beaten through war in Europe. TR branch wiggled
its way out of that loss.. They hid in the cracks of the society,
occasionally getting out and messing shit up. Zionists were already
well protected behind their shield of victimization, they could not be
criticized for anything, in fear of being called anti-Semite. That is
at least two countries today who harbor a rotten form of nationalism,
a kind that long should have been swept under the carpet.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
