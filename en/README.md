year-over-year"

Makes sense, [AFAIK](2017/12/palestine.md#lebanon) Lebanon came to being bcz of France.

Sure, but, when they get out, they cause a stir because it's
Google. Then the only next step the company can take to offset that
splash with another splash, firing the employee.

This is the downside of working at a company like Google, right? There
are upsides, go to a bar, show off to women saying you work for
Google. But then there is the downside, the scrutiny. Cant have one
wout the other.

"But that fired Google guy and many others talk freely about stuff on
their internal forums, the problem was posts got out and media caused a frenzy"

Forget Marx. Take Toffler, add little Rapaille, Ian Morris, and you'll
reach what I reached. 

"On the 60th anniversary of Sartre's key text on Marxism, Robert
Boncardo shows us why it is still relevant, and urgently needed today"

It's likely no persistent politics will come out of DJT years.

"@jimgeraghty

This week, Kris Kobach lost his primary in Kansas. Earlier this cycle,
aspiring senator Roy Moore lost his primary in Alabama and Steve King
lost his primary in Iowa. Arpaio is narrowly trailing his now.

The Trump style doesn’t work for his wannabes"

"Mazzucato was increasingly interested in what she called
mission-oriented organisations. The prime example was DARPA, the
research agency founded by President Eisenhower in 1958 following the
Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik. The agency pumped billions of
dollars into the development of prototypes that preceded commercial
technology such as Microsoft Windows, videoconferencing, Google Maps,
Linux and the cloud. In Israel, Yozma, a government-backed venture
capital fund that ran between 1993 and 1998, supported more than 40
companies. In the UK, the Government Digital Service, launched in
2010, was behind the award-winning .gov.uk domain, saving the
government £1.7bn in IT procurement. “When I use the word ‘state’ I am
talking about a decentralised network of different state agencies,"
she says. When such agencies are mission-oriented to solve problems
and structured to take risks, they can be an engine of innovation.”

To Mazzucato, the epitome of the mission-oriented concept was the
Apollo programme, the space programme designed to land Americans on
the Moon and return them safely to Earth. Between 1960 and 1972, the
US government spent $26bn (£21bn) to achieve precisely that. More than
300 different projects contributed, not only in aeronautics but in
areas such as nutrition, textiles, electronics and medicine, resulting
in 1,800 spinoff products, from freeze-dried food to cooling suits,
spring tyres and digital fly-by-wire flight control systems used in
commercial airplanes. The programme was also instrumental in
kick-starting an industry for the integrated circuit"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
