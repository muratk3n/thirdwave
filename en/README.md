The Guardian: "Israel is committing the crime of apartheid, rights
watchdog says.. Human Rights Watch calls on international criminal
court to investigate ‘systematic discrimination’ against
Palestinians.. has accused Israeli officials of committing the crimes
of apartheid and persecution, claiming the government enforces an
overarching policy to “maintain the domination by Jewish Israelis over
Palestinians”. In a report released on Tuesday, the New York-based
advocacy group became the first major international rights body to
level such allegations"

resources to make stuff happen.. But who does he answer to? Noone
elected him.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
