You are one with the tree... Trippy dude.

"[D]espite the incredible diversity of living things, animals, plants,
and the enormous variety and diversity of micro-organisms, we all have
characteristics that we share.  The same biochemical base, the same
DNA as genetic material, and we're all based on the same proteins.
Everything that's in bacteria, fungus, birds, whales or plants is the
same stuff"

If there are cheap, large scale processes that can generate green H2,
a company like Solar Foods can skip the step of generating it on their
own, just purchase it on the market, speeding up the process.

---

H2 will be required even to produce food! Energy for the car, energy for you!

"Solar Foods, a Finland-based company, has developed a process to use
renewable electricity and CO2 to produce a healthy ingredient that
looks like wheat flour and contains 50% protein. 'Because we don’t use
sugars, or similar agricultural feedstocks, we can completely
disconnect from agriculture,' Vainikka says. The process uses solar
power to split water through electrolysis in a bioreactor, creating
hydrogen that can give microbes energy as they’re also fed carbon. The
microbes produce a food that’s composed of roughly 20-25% carbs, 5-10%
fat, and 50% protein"

"The cost of proteins will be five times cheaper by 2030 and 10 times
cheaper by 2035 than existing animal proteins, before ultimately
approaching the cost of sugar. They will also be superior in every key
attribute – more nutritious, healthier, better tasting, and more
convenient, with almost unimaginable variety.

This means that, by 2030, modern food products will be higher quality
and cost less than half as much to produce as the animal-derived
products they replace.

The impact of this disruption on industrial animal farming will be
profound. By 2030, the number of cows in the U.S. will have fallen by
50% and the cattle farming industry will be all but bankrupt"

Li-On  battery tech cannot be scaled.

Mainstream storage neeeds to be based on something else.

---

If everyone used batteries to store energy, below is the amt of
lithium needed.. Single person consumes 10 KW of energy, 240 Kwh /
day, to hold the energy required for a day, for everyone,


```python
consumption = 10 # kw, per person
pop = 7.8e9 # world population
daily_world_consumption = consumption*24*pop # kwh
kg_lit_needed = daily_world_consumption / 70.0 * 60.0
print ('needed', int(kg_lit_needed / 1e9)) # billion kg, million ton
```

```text
needed 1604
```

Required litihum is over 90 TIMES of available reserves.

---

There is >60kg of lithium carbonate in a 70kWh battery. The entire
world reserve for lithium is estimated to be ~17 million tonnes.

Simply put, there isn't enough of this shit to go around.

---

400 liters of water is used per kilo of lithium production. Major waste.

Water use is a problem bcz while lithium rich water is dug up, potable
water resources also shift.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
