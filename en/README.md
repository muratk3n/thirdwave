Grading (only pass/fail) which takes the least amount of time, can
remain in-person, craftsman-like, but through certifiers. The process
will also be async, paving the way for the system's eventual
transition to 3W.

Let's truly [modernise](2018/09/public-education.md), so the crux of
ed, so the delivery has a guaranteed quality.

Modernity, as in industrial production, gives you products that are
copies of a template; I buy a 27'' LCD monitor, it is exactly like the
next 27'' LCD monitor produced by the same brand.

But education still varies from teacher to teacher because we chose to
deliver lectures through individuals.. Ed therefore is still not a
product. It is treated as some sort of pre-modern craft. Just like
there was the shoemaker, ironsmith, bakery, there is.. the
teacher. Shoemaker works on his shoes, his product is as good as he
can make it, teacher same way. We modernized shoemaking, all kinds of
food prep but we only modernized [some parts](2011/02/grading.md) of
ed, of the "craft", ending up with a bastardized, bizarre mixture of
modern and pre-modern. Grading is an industrial approach.

What modern education..? It's not even modern!

"What is wrong with modern education?"

The shoddiest version of everything can be found in gobble gobble.. couldn't
you at least _try_ to be a good conspiracy theorist? F-ing losah

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
