"South Korea's POSCO plans to eventually halt carbon emissions by
switching to a hydrogen-based steelmaking process from 2021, company
officials said on Friday.  POSCO, the world's fourth-largest
steelmaker, accounts for 10 percent of the country's total carbon
emissions"

Space scifi is kind of naval submarine scifi. The ships are floating,
can't just "step outside", etc. Living space size inside the ships are
different of course.

Daily Poster: "With millions of Americans trapped at home to protect
themselves from a deadly pandemic during the holiday season, the
Internet is one of the only conduits connecting them to friends,
family and the outside world. Now, Comcast, one of the monopoly
corporations that controls the conduit, isÂ extendingÂ its fees on
bandwidth usage to all 39 states where it operates â€” even as the
company has received hundreds of millions of dollars of public
subsidies and new tax breaks"

I knew there was something behind this interest, other than the art
piece itself. There is nothing special about the piece really. 

"Before its theft [in 1911], the 'Mona Lisa' was not widely known
outside the art world. Leonardo da Vinci painted it in 1507, but it
wasn't until the 1860s that critics began to hail it as a masterwork
of Renaissance painting. And that judgment didn't filter outside a
thin slice of French intelligentsia. ...

After the Louvre announced the theft, newspapers all over the world
ran headlines about the missing masterpiece.

'60 Detectives Seek Stolen 'Mona Lisa,' French Public Indignant,' the
New York Times declared. The heist had become something of a national
scandal.

'In France, there was a great deal of concern that American
millionaires were buying up the legacy of France â€” the best
paintings,' Dorothy Hoobler says. At one point, American tycoon and
art lover J.P. Morgan was suspected of commissioning the theft. Pablo
Picasso was also considered a suspect, and was questioned.

And as tensions were escalating between France and Germany ahead of
World War I, 'there were people who thought the Kaiser was behind it,'
Hoobler says"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
