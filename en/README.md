Politico: "President Joe Biden wants to fund his $4.1 trillion
infrastructure and family policy agenda with a huge pile of tax
increases on corporations and the wealthy. The business community is
dismissing the threat.

Corporate executives and lobbyists in Washington, New York and around
the country say they are confident they can kill almost all of these
tax hikes by pressuring moderate Democrats in the House and Senate"

Jacobin: "As an Occupier, Israel Has No Right to 'Self-Defense'.. This
commonsense statement is repeated everywhere — by state officials and
media outlets, by commentators and anchors. It seems so basic and
self-evident that it is hard to argue with. But today Israel uses
self-defense as its key rhetorical tool for war. By invoking
self-defense, Israel changes the conversation from its colonial crimes
against the Palestinians to the injuries it has itself incurred as a
result. Yet it is precisely because Israel is denying Palestinians
their human rights, including the right of self-determination, that it
cannot claim self-defense as a legal justification for the use of
force"

Burgis: "[T]he underlying phenomenon [of cancel culture] is real.... I
don’t want the Left to eat itself, because I want us to win. If we’re
going to get everyone health care and end police violence at home and
imperialist wars abroad and expand democracy into the workplace, we
need to learn to appeal to the broadest possible subset of the
population. Far too many people whose material interests align with
our program will find the face the Left often presents to the world
deeply unappealing"

YOu could certainly make that case for fascism, communism, or any -ism
that did not work, couldn't you? These -isms[ didn't work bcz they are
too far removed from reality and it took too much effort to prop them
up rather than throwing them out, in many places in the world.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
