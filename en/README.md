"Recycling lithium" is a non-starter for another reason. Reserves are
limited, as in insufficient, and since recycling does not magically
create new reserves, the main problem remains unresolved. Not enough
fucking lithium.

Trek isn't about the "Federation" necessarily either.. How do these
fools at Bad Reboot (a JJ outfit) watch these shows? With eyes closed?
They seem to have perfected the "superficial pay homage" move, e.g. in
*Into the Darkness* Khan says "my name is Khan" veery deliberately, BR
is like ok, u remember that right, I pressed that button now we are
okay? That was cool right..? Like it's a fan thing..? It's not a fan
thing. Roddenberry's creation is the whole package, not some building,
or some word you pay random homage to.

Earth surface area (including sea) 510.1 million km².

How much area for 1 person?

```python
area = ( 510.1  / (7.5 * 1e3) * 1e6  ) 
print ("%.2f m2" %  area )
print ("side %.2f m" %  np.sqrt(area) )
```

```text
68013.33 m2
side 260.79 m
```

Not too wide of an area.. a square with one side 260 meters..

Lota people.

I cannot believe post 911 was spent on such shoddy-ass solutions on
the climate. Pursued BTW by ppl who were seen as "smart" too. Simple
arithmetic could have shown what's what... So sad.

\#Belarus Military vehicles are coming from various direction. Mobile
internet is shutdown. 12 metro stations in #Minsk are closed. The
authorities are clearly scared, as they are doing it earlier than
usual"

IMO there will come a time when Russia will actively be involved
spreading democracy itself. At least to the level it itself has.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
