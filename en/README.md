t Hooft: "Fast moving classical variables can generate quantum
mechanical behavior. We demonstrate how this can happen in a
model. The key point is that in classically (ontologically) evolving
systems one can still define a conserved quantum energy ...

It will be shown that quantum mechanical cor- relation functions can
be most easily explained if we assume the existence of very high
frequency oscillations, which give rise to energy levels way beyond
the regime of the Standard Model. When these fast oscillating
quantities are handled as classical variables that have to be smeared
over short, finite periods of time, one obtains the familiar operator
structure for quantum mechanical systems. ...

The classical system we start with is absolutely classical, hence it
does away with collapse axioms, measurement problems, pilot waves and
many worlds. All we need is fast variables such as the vacuum
fluctuations due to heavy particles, many of which must be unknown
today. The fast variables are moving completely classically, but too
fast to be followed by the ‚Äòobservers‚Äô in our model"

Goood. Unix utility `mpv` can play `.pls` URLs, handy for
streaming. Pick one with low bitrate, u can replace radio.

Termux on Android has `mpv` (again command line, on a smartphone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Noone did - except Merkel. At institutional level, Europe..  In a 2011
book Rifkin talks all about it. Between 2003-06 he had major access,
and Germany made major commitments around this time. If DE/EU is
further ahead right now, that's why.

"If Rifkin made such big waves in 01-02, did govs listen and plan?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
