"But almost everyone appears to agree on one thing. In some way or
other, space-time itself seems to fall apart at a black hole, implying
that space-time is not the root level of reality, but an emergent
structure from something deeper. Although Einstein conceived of
gravity as the geometry of space-time, his theory also entails the
dissolution of space-time, which is ultimately why information can
escape its gravitational prison"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
