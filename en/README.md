Given all these potential weak spots I dont understand why more do not
support opportunities to boost any point in the pipeline.

I love it now all arguments can be turned around verbatim against the
English. "Will of the people!". "Freedom!"

Hah.. I bet the same thing EU told Britain before their referandum

"With a pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament, Prime
Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was 'best served when we work
together.'"

UK (Scotland) election: Final result (seats)

"Scotland's Independence Parties Gain Upper Hand as Pressure Builds on
U.K... SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon is pushing a referendum plan with Green
Party allies as Boris Johnson gains ground in England"

Many things are possible.. but viable? Efficient? That is the
question. If one is fine cutting 100 mile from his range, wait a day
while the f-ing truck charges during long trips, 8 tons added to his
curb weight, fine. Like aspirin is "fine" for cancer, or cutting fat
from diet but drinking Coca-Cola. It's all "fine".

"But battery trucks are possible"

We hear the occasional lefty muttering from even G. Brown, the other
one-time "New Labor" leader -- he supported covid patent
waiver.. Where is TB? Drop this Third Way, TINA, Clinton bullshit

Now that Labor centrists took a beating, it's time for a left
turn. The sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey was a mistake. She needs to
be the next leader of Labor. And forget this anti-semitism non-sense

Oh yea Keir was his guy

Tony Blair lost on Thursday.

Because it'd make them feel butt-hurt, giving out hundreds of millions
rather than mere millions, so they would not be incentivized to *help*
us, "disrupt" industries and shit, fight our crime when government
fails like Batman

"@M_SullivanTax

Ways and Means will have a hearing Wednesday on taxation of wealthy.
Doesn't it all boil down to:

Fact: the super rich are taxed at lower effective rate than a
2-earner-middle class couple.

Then ask: Is there any reason to tax the rich at a lower rate than the
middle class?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
