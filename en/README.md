hinder the achievement of worldwide protection against Covid-19"

Sure I tie lots of thing into this payment scheme, eg digital UBI.

Patreon is not good enough, ppl still have to signup to this
particular service. Monetized likes, naming all needs to be integrated
into an omnipresent payment scheme.

Docu shows challenges around paying for content in a post-industrial
era. My take: we need voluntery, "monetized likes" scheme tied to a
new crypto. Fast payment tech, connect to a naming system (akin to
Twitter checkmark), then while listening to a song (downloaded from
.. wherever), if liked, u send small payment to just a name. Bee Gees?
Weekend? Send it to that name and it gets routed to the artist.

Archimedes circle area formula invention is not covered at
schools.. Sad state of our ed system.. Stuff that should be taught
first arrives last. It is as if they don't want innovative,
free-thinking people.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
