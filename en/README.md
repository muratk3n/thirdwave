transport hydrogen"

Of course the "battery" tech mentioned here uses H2 combined with a
metal hydride. It is basically creating renewable fuel internally, on
demand.

This speaks to the versatility of the approach.. H2 can be stored in
huge amounts, transported with ease, and in a certain type of usages,
yes, it can also act like a battery.

"With Texan power outages hitting the headlines this week, it‚Äôs worth
looking to a startup that‚Äôs developed the world‚Äôs first renewable,
hydrogen-powered energy storage system. At full charge, it can furnish
a house with electricity for about three days"

"South Australia has met 100% of its electricity demands with solar
energy for the first time over the weekend‚Äîmost of it coming not from
solar farms but PV panels mounted on rooftops"

Good acting by Ch O'Don. But IMO playing Robin to nipple-suit batman

No, AU is proposing a new math to simplify current approaches, a more
expressive language in a way.. Not stuffing, squeezing shite into
extra dimensions so some data fits better.

"Is the [quaternion idea](2021/02/unzicker.md#quaternions) an hidden
dimension approach to physics?"

We‚Äôre back at the bargaining table tomorrow, and we‚Äôve told @newyorker
and @condenast management that we expect them to bring a serious
counter to our wage proposal‚Äîone that will let us begin remedying
decades of low, stagnant, irregular pay"

"@jonathanavila

Do any other hydrogen #fuelcell drivers get that awkward look from
surrounding motorist when you accelerate and all the H2O spews out of
the tailpipe?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
