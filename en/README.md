Because that would be a disincentive for EU members to stay / be in
the EU.  If they felt their pieces would just be taken in, then
there's no incentive to be a member. But, if you are __not__ in the EU
like the UK is not, anymore, especially after a bad divorce like the
one UK had, then the EU could be like "fine, come on in, in pieces,
whatever".

"Why would EU care about pieces of countries joining to it, or not, like Catalonia?"

Let's talk about the phenomenon of 'mathcoins' and how fancy tech and
academic obscurantism is used to defraud the public into buying scam
crypto investments. 

Cryptocurrencies are nothing but a form of investment fraud that
enriches a small group of people by directing funds from new investors
to pay out old investors. They're a variant of the classic Ponzi
scheme, but where the cashflows are obscured with internet
technology. 

Now Ponzis schemes can indeed make people very rich. Madoff got rich,
and made plenty of his early investors rich. But at some point there
is an inflection point in which cash outflows exceed inflows and the
scheme inevitably collapses. 

Any conman will tell you, swindling a mark requires more than just
deceit, and you have to mix lies with truth. You need a story with a
germ of an idea crystallised around a narrative that is seemingly
plausible and that someone already feels an emotional attachment
to. 

Bitcoin's narrative is crystallized around alt-right populism, a
strange variant of Austrian economics, goldbuggery, distrust of
institutions and resentment about the 2008 financial crisis.  While
Dogecoin is basically built around pure nihilism. 

With this germ of the narrative in place, the next step is to buy
yourself some credibility to play the long con and convince people
that your token somehow isn't like the thousands of other scams. That
it will stand the test of time and be "real". 

It's a straightforward arrangement, you ask respected people in their
field to trade their reputation for cash to promote your token
investment. And because having someone at arm's length who does the
illicit toting of the investment keeps your hands clean...

Keep in mind that all cryptocurrencies are designed to be investments
that divert massive amounts of funds to insiders who create them. This
creates an inherent moral hazard to engaging in this sort of
deal. 

For most tokens these people are rappers, Hollywood actors,
influencers, or other notable celebrities or public figures.

The narrative is simple: Rapper X is collaborating so it's a winner.

Go watch the Netflix Fyre festival documentary if you want to see how
this ends....

Most mathcoins were started during the ICO bubble of 2017 and are
nothing but a fork of bitcoin code attached to a rambling whitepaper
for what amounts to an economic perpetual motion machine but rendered
in the LaTeX typesetting system to appear credible. 

They'll use some combination of crackpot tokenomics, cryptography,
proof of stake, zero-knowledge proofs, smart contracts, and
"artificial scarcity" to make a rambling argument that makes sense
until you look at the details. But most people can't understand the
details. 

These papers all look seemingly plausible, are full of equations,
economic notation, game theory and tons of seemingly plausible content
... except for one notable exception:

They can't tell you what problem they're trying to solve.

It's not secret that grants money in academia is hard to come by these
days, so a lot of universities have turned to a back room deals with
crypto companies to make ends meet.

This kind of low-level corruption is widespread across the US and Europe.

Imperial College London got in hot water when the press exposed that
researchers were using their academic credentials to write marketing
material for promoting token investments on the shady crypto broker
eToro. 

To this day the University of Edinburgh has an entire blockchain lab
that does nothing but whitewash crypto and print marketing material
about very questionable crypto investments.
https://ed.ac.uk/informatics/blockchain

Algorand is a crypto claiming to be some hand-wavy "decentralized
revolution" with no lack of big ideas, but a big lack of any real
application.

The marketing slathers the eminent 'Massachusetts Institute of
Technology' brand all over the digital penny-stock prospectus. 

Despite all this "innovative" research, crypto can't escape the simple
fact that it's not used for anything but get-rich-quick schemes.

MIT's cryptocurrency is massively outperformed by a coin whose
'research' is a talking shiba that Elon Musk tweets about while
stoned. ...

Indeed, there is a pervasive meme in software circles, that all
software is value-neutral.

However outside of software circles, nobody believes that. 

Slot machines are purposely designed to feed on a person‚Äôs gambling
addiction and to take their money.

Dirty bombs are designed as weapons of mass death.

Cryptocurrencies are designed as mass investment frauds.

The days in which technology, especially those with vast reach, can be
considered in an intellectual vacuum are long gone.

And the tragic human cost of crypto research being used to proliferate
financial scams is very real"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
