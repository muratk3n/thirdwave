Schumer has lined up June votes on high-priority Dem bills that won't
get 60 votes, maybe not even 50. It'll be a reality check, but some
are reading the tea leaves and hoping this is some strategic L-taking
in service of ending the filibuster"

I like how UK and Oz parliament's have speakers who regulate question
time, and whoever talks talks to him/her do not address any opponent
directly, unless its a direct question to someone in gov. Its a useful
custom that can reduce friction, add little etiquette, help raise
discourse above trash talk.

Perhaps worse than half-assed, unverified theories in fundam physics
is half-assed but seemingly verified theories. The Big Bang's
existence is not conclusive. It is based on a few shoddy theories and
some measurements that can be explained in different ways.

But it is accepted as base truth, now new theories feel the burden to
coexist with it. This is ten times worse than weirdo bullshit like
String Theory, multiple universes, etc.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
