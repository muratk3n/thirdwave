That's lota of f-ing people, for one. Second, if the spread is too
fast, it overhelms the health system, which most government in the EU
and elsewhere are responsible for. That's why govs panick when R goes
too much over 1. Plus slowing the spread buys time; cure, vaccine, etc.

"If covid is let roam free and 1% of people die, that is one years
worth of world population growth. Why care?"

Very industrious, capitalist of you SBC

"The 'Borat 2' babysitter says she only made $3,600 for being tricked
in the film. Now, she's unemployed and feels 'betrayed.'"

The seemingly daring nature of his pranks hide the fact that these are
safe protests to make. After wide condemnation of W ME policies, it is
safe to "get" Cheney, in a culture where there is already tolerance
for that stuff. Is it safe to say millions have no health insurance
and Dems have done nothing abt it for decades? Say that shit, maybe
they'll pull the money for your next Borat movie.

SBC thinks Twitter alone is responsible for Trump's 2016 election
BTW. He doesn't really get what is going on. His main crowd seems to
be affluent centrist types who just want to be served up some safe
resistance.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
