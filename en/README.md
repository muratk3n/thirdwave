DW: "Opinion: China's New Silk Road is full of potholes. As the harsh
realities of China's growing power sink in, the county's appeal is
diminishing in the West. To keep it in check, more coordinated efforts
are needed and come September the tone from Germany may be decisive"

F24: "US President Joe Biden’s administration on Wednesday announced
support for a global waiver on patent protections for Covid-19
vaccines, offering hope to poor nations that have struggled to access
the life-saving doses"

Deutsche Welle: "EU-China investment deal put on ice over sanctions"

MB: "[T]he Filipino president, Rodrigo Duterte, has repeatedly
threatened to downgrade the U.S.-Filipino alliance, but he also has
authorized the United States to upgrade its military facilities in the
Philippines, ordered further reclamation on Philippine-held islands in
the Spratlys, instructed Filipino troops to 'fight to the death' to
defend these 95 ​islands against China, and threatened to raise the
Philippine flag himself on Thitu Island and to ride out to other
Chinese-claimed features on his jet ski and plant Philippine flags on
them too"

---

MB: "China’s neighbors have shown that they are willing to use
military force against China’s civilian vessels. Indonesia and
Malaysia, for example, announced in 2016 that they would sink foreign
vessels that fish or drill in their claimed waters in the South China
Sea, and Indonesia made good on this promise at least three times in
2016, firing on Chinese fishing vessels and blowing them up on
national TV—all while Chinese coast guard cutters watched from a
distance"

---

MB: "China .. cannot enforce its South China Sea claims. The sea is a
hotly contested zone, with five other countries laying claims to
portions of ​it. China has a more powerful military than these
Southeast Asian states, but they are closer than China to the areas of
the sea that they claim. In a war, Chinese forces would need to cycle
between the combat theater and a few bases hundreds of miles away in
southern China to refuel and reload, a commute that would severely
limit the amount of combat power China could sustain on the
battlefield. Southeast Asian forces, by contrast, could operate from
home bases bordering the combat theater and would have their full
arsenals at their disposal"

---

MB: "China’s neighbors have developed their own A2/AD capabilities,
which can deny China sea and air control throughout most of its near
seas—even without U.S. assistance"

---

MB: "[Due to amphibious difficulties] China, therefore, probably could
not conquer Taiwan, even in the absence of U.S. intervention. Even if
China’s prospects are better than I have suggested, the PLA clearly
would have its hands full just dealing with Taiwan’s defenders.
Consequently, the United States would only need to tip the scales of
the battle to foil a Chinese invasion, a mission that could be
accomplished in numerous ways without exposing U.S. surface ships or
nonstealth aircraft to China’s [antiaccess-areadenial -A2/AD-] forces.
Specifically, American defense planners estimate that it would take
ten thousand to twenty thousand pounds of ordnance to decimate a PLA
invasion force on the beaches of Taiwan. The U.S. military could
deliver that payload many times over with a single B-2 bomber or an
Ohio-class submarine firing cruise missiles from an underwater
location hundreds of miles away. Alternatively, the United States
could unleash its attack submarines on the PLA invasion fleet"

---

MB: "[In a conflict with Taiwan] China would try to sink merchant
ships supplying Taiwan, but rigorous research suggests that the PLA
could sink only 1 to 6 percent of Taiwan’s shipping, and these results
are based on assumptions that heavily favor China... China might hope
that sinking a few merchant ships would deter others from supplying
Taiwan. Historically, however, shipping companies and privateers have
operated in wartime; in fact, many have volunteered to enter dangerous
areas so that they could charge higher premiums. For example, the lure
of profits kept seaborne commerce going throughout both world wars and
the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War, wars in which shipping losses were several
times greater than what China could hope to inflict on Taiwan"

---

MB: "[R]ecent internal investigations found that the PLA 'is riddled
with corruption and professional decay, compromised by ties of
patronage, and asphyxiated by the ever-greater effort required to
impose political control.' According to U.S. intelligence assessments,
'the level of corruption in the PLA at least equals, and probably far
exceeds, the level of corruption in the civilian economy.'"

---

MB: "When Chinese firms imported foreign technology, they spent less
than 25 percent of the total cost on absorbing the technology, a share
far lower than the 200 to 300 percent spent by Korean and Japanese
firms when they were trying to catch up to the West in the 1970s. As a
result, many Chinese firms remain dependent on foreign technologies
and manual labor and have a rudimentary level of automation and
digitization"

---

MB: "According to a former Chinese biochemist turned whistle-blower,
'misconduct is so widespread among Chinese academics that they have
almost become used to it.' China now leads the world in retractions of
scientific studies due to fraud"

---

MB: "Since 2006, [CH] has tripled its spending on research and
development (R&D), employed more scientists and engineers than any
other country, and mounted the most extensive corporate espionage
campaign in history. So far, however, these measures have failed to
turn China into an innovation powerhouse"

---

MB: "[O]ne-third of China’s GDP and 90 percent of its high-technology
goods are produced by foreign firms that have merely set up factories
in China to snap together components produced elsewhere. This
practice, known as 'export processing,' accounts for 90 percent of
China’s high-technology exports and 100 percent of China’s trade
surplus. On average, of every dollar an American consumer spends on an
item labeled 'Made in China,' 55 cents go for components and services
produced in the United States. In other words, more than half of the
content of 'Made in China' is American"

---

MB: "Whereas the United States can feed itself with only 1 percent of
its workforce in agriculture, China devotes 30 percent of its
workforce to farming—and still depends on food imports to feed its
population... Economic development is, at its core, a process of
structural change from agriculture to industry"

---

MB: "American live in a less toxic environment. Air pollution is seven
times worse in China than in the United States and kills 1.6 million
Chinese citizens each year versus 200,000 Americans. Breathing
Beijing’s air is the equivalent of smoking forty cigarettes a day.

---

MB: "Many Chinese college students describe their schools as 'diploma
factories,' where student-teacher ratios are double the average in
U.S. universities, cheating is rampant, students spend a quarter of
their time studying 'Mao Zedong thought'"

---

*Unrivaled*, M. Beckley: "Entrepreneurs in China have reported
spending roughly 70 percent of their time schmoozing with party
members"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
