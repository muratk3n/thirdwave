"[F]or a time, Kushner and his conciliatory views toward China seemed
to have won out. After Trump's inauguration .., Kushner was the
official who had the direct line to Beijing, so he had the most
influence. He was listening to Henry Kissinger, Mnuchin, Cohn, and the
billionaires, all of whom steered him toward a friendly relationship
managed at the very top of both governments"

CCP lovin Kusshhhhh 

"It soon became clear to the [China] hawks that Kushner‚Äôs instincts

"Mnuchin, the former investment banker and movie producer, became the
head of the Treasury Department and the lead official for dealing with
Beijing on trade negotiations, along with Lighthizer. He also played a
complex and covert game pushing back against the China hawks inside
the system for years, defending the interests of his Wall Street
associates and, some would say, the pro-China lobby in Washington"

"During the campaign, dozens of GOP foreign policy establishment
figures signed public letters condemning Trump's candidacy. Those who
didn't sign such letters were privately pressured not to join Trump's
movement. That's why Trump had to rely on amateurs and unknown
outsiders like George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and J. D. Gordon to
staff him on foreign policy during the campaign. They weren't Russian
assets. They were fringe players in the GOP foreign policy scene who
loved the idea of a huge payoff from a longshot bet on a kooky
candidate"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
