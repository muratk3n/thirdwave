Zionism also carries the residue of the 30s. They were crushed by that
nationalism, but in a bizarre reversal, they assumed it (the tortured
imitating the torturer), and under the protective shield of their
victimization nursed it to this day.

See [people without a land, and a land without people](2020/06/10-myths-israel.md#land)

Similar bullshit: "we arrived in the our lands, and there was noone
there".

Ethnic nationalism was en vogue then.. Some thought Germans "descended
from Proto-Aryans, who [..]  dwelt on the North German Plain and may
ultimately have originated on the lost continent of Atlantis". That
*herrenvolk* business.. FROM ATLANTIS. Some dumb-ass shit right? Kinda
similar to bunch of punks from Central Asia rolling into Anatolia,
*finding it empty*, bringing civilization there, right? *tiggervolk*

Kemal wanted to adapt stuff from the West, yes. But he took some
defunct ideas from 30s

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
