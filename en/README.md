Corollary: True change happens top-down, not bottom-up.

They can gauge whether they are doing good or bad and vote for the
'other' (enough for democracy to work).

Bad policies sink, good policies raise -- in the long run. If ur party
is constantly putting up bad policies, ppl might choose 'other' on you
more than the next guy. Also if major blocs are all failing constantly
u might get the occasional fascist who'll run roughshod over the whole
thing.

[Exactly](2016/11/why-is-democracy-better.md#elections). People don't
know shit.  That's why you dont put them on the spot for specific
policy (see Brexit).  

"Are you saying you can 'spin' people? They are not wise processors of
information?"

It can work; the spin that is. Im not sure Dems want anything passed
that wld help Trump before election anyway.

"In many of the competitive races, Republicans have risked their seats
by jamming through the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney
Barrett [.. m]eanwhile, a desperately needed stimulus bill continues
to languish. This is precisely the message Senate Democrats used to
make the four-day Barrett hearings into a advertisement against Senate
Republicans"

"@EmmaVigeland

The Hunter Biden attacks just aren’t landing. Rare misfire by the
traditionally well oiled right-wing propaganda machine. Enormously
convoluted and niche... It just has no punch in the middle of an
economic depression and deadly pandemic"

Assange is in solitary.

Snowden's in exile.

Corbyn's suspended by his own party.

Now Glenn Greenwald's been censored by The Intercept.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
