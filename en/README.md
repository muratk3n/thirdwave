"Of 43 U.S. House seats that flipped from Republican to Democratic
control in the 2018 midterms, 14 flipped back to GOP control in 2020,
while 29 remained in Democratic hands. Though data is not yet
complete, there are signs that these districtsâ€™ House vote in 2020
mostly mirrored their vote for president"

Saw on ABC, the host seemed ready to jump on the guest for perceived
sleight on labor, there is less flash for one thing, which is great,
and the general attitude doesnt seem to be obnoxiously capitalistic,
as it is in US.

Toffler, The Third Wave: "Built on the factory model, mass education
taught basic reading, writing, and arithmetic, a bit of history and
other subjects. This was the 'overt curriculum.' But beneath it lay an
invisible or 'covert curriculum' that was far more basic. It
consistedâ€”and still does in most industrial nationsâ€”of three courses:
one in punctuality, one in obedience, and one in rote, repetitive
work. Factory labor demanded workers who showed up on time, especially
assembly-line hands. It demanded workers who would take orders from a
management hierarchy without questioning. And it demanded men and
 women prepared to slave away at machines or in offices, performing
brutally repetitious operations"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
