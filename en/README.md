Many of the WWII participants avoid the "N-word", like US. If a word
in the neighborhood is rarely needed patriotism is used instead. Some
in Trump WH tried to bring it back, as in "economic natinoalism" but
it didn't work.

Needless to day the word is everywhere in TR.

There is some outdated lingo around this issue.. Just because you call
yourself "communist" that doesn't automatically make your opponent
"nationalist". Or said country isn't nationalist itself.. Nationalism
can infect anyone..

Yea.. I was told not only EA was against SAF, he was the poster-child
for its opposition. For the campaign however, he probably wanted to
balance that image, that's why he was more "pro-cop", with all that
carrying-a-gun talk etc \#ABC.

New Yorker: "Adams spoke out against [stop-and-frisk] abuses at its
height, and testified in a federal trial that prompted the department
to drastically reduce the number of stops its officers made. But, now
that the fight has been won by the reformers, he has become a lonely
voice speaking up for stop-and-frisk as a necessary police tactic if
it is used in a limited and appropriate way"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
