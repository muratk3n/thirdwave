Hitler's story begins here

"Currency War I began in 1921 in Weimar Germany when the Reichsbank,
Germany’s central bank, set about to destroy the value of the German
mark through massive money printing and hyperinflation... Capital
flight is a traditional response to currency collapse... Even the
German bourgeoisie was not immediately alarmed as losses in the value
of their currency were offset by stock market gains. The fact that
these gains were denominated in soon to be worthless marks had not yet
occurred to many. Finally, those who held unionized and government
jobs were initially hedged as well because the government simply
granted wage increases commensurate with inflation.

Of course, not everyone had a government or union job, stock
portfolio, hard assets or foreign operations to insulate them. Those
most devastated were middle-class pensioners who no longer qualified
for raises and savers who kept their funds in banks rather than
stocks. These Germans were completely financially ruined. Many were
forced to sell their furniture to raise a few marks to pay for food
and keep going. Pianos were particularly in demand and became a form
of currency on their own. Some elderly couples whose savings had been
destroyed would go into the kitchen, hold hands, place their heads in
the oven and turn on the gas in a poignant form of suicide"

The bizarre pol discourse generates its own bizarre language.. The
Berlin Wall collapsed on the Democrats, who then tried to outdo Rep in
their own game (econ right), which caused both going extreme on social
issues for differentiation... These issues, being moral and
fundamental, were unsolvable, so a constant fighting atmo set in.

Into this environment steps in the politician, in the 11th inning,
trying to sell "unification", being a "uniter not a divider". This is
of course like trying to reason with lung cancer when you should have
smoked less. Another layer of crud on top of layers of crud. I cant
argue with the efficacy of it when it is, but such talk is akin to
kicking the can down the road. It's fluff. It's tofu.

anything.. that is their real problem.

Haha.. "fucking bond traders", "being born again as the bond
market". Glib bullshit accompanied by technobabbling drama covering up
for lack of left-courage while trying to look TV-suave.. The strength
of this junk gave rise to *The West Wing*, taking place around
drama-infused boomer morons passing eachother papers while
accomplishing nothing.

"Clinton came face to face with the ideological power surrounding
deficit reduction at a January 7, 1993, meeting at the governor’s
mansion in Little Rock. There, Rubin, just selected to head Clinton’s
National Economic Council (NEC), and Panetta, the new chief of the
Office of Management and Budget, put forward the case for deficit
reduction, sidelining proposals for the large, innovative stimulus
that Clinton had advocated during the campaign. ... [S]tubbornly high
long-term interest rates had convinced Wall Streeters, including
Rubin, that a huge reservoir of investment money lay frozen and
untapped. Interest rates on long-term bonds were now at above 7
percent. Lower interest rates would arguably free up investment and
spending far beyond Robert Reich’s proposed $50 billion stimulus
program.

But cutting the budget meant eliminating much of the social investment
raison d’être promised during the campaign. Clinton campaign
strategists like James Carville, Paul Begala, Stan Greenberg, and
Mandy Grunwald, as well as Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner, were
incredulous. There were no guarantees that shelving campaign promises
would generate a positive response from the bond market, even if
Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan delivered easier monetary policy
in exchange for deficit reduction. An appalled Clinton, confronted
with reality according to Rubin, told his economic team, “You mean to
tell me that the success of the program and my re-election hinges on
the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders?” Carville
would later remark that were he to be born again, he wanted to be
reincarnated as the most powerful thing in the world, the bond market.

But it was Clinton himself who had appointed deficit hawks like Rubin
and Bentsen, the new secretary of the Treasury, who in turn chose the
orthodox Summers as a top assistant, later to succeed Bentsen as
secretary"

Libs being self-righteous on anything is the most repulsive thing ever.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
