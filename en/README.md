"Abolish CIA & FISA... At home, the Agencies are partisan institutions
illegitimately focused on setting national policy. Abroad, Agencies
untied to specific operational concerns are inherently dangerous and
low-value"

From that book abt a Titan colony, 23rd century.. The comm issue would
be real. No Zoom calls with Saturn bitch.

A. C. Clarke: "It might have been different if the velocity of light
were infinite; but it was a mere billion kilometers an hour—and
therefore, real-time conversation would be forever impossible between
Earth and anyone beyond the orbit of the Moon. The global electronic
village which had existed for centuries on the mother world could
never be extended into space; the political and psychological effects
of this were enormous, and still not fully understood"

Demonstrative, To the point, running, skeletal example code is worth
it line count in diamonds.

Another one for <250 LOC. 2D, but still..

Have a major fluid dynamics simulation running with <500 LOC C++
SPH. Only API calls are for graphics, the rest is physics. Fine
approach.

SPH is awesome

This rule is ironclad. Other rules in scifi can be bent or broken, not
this one.

If there is an evil twin in the other universe, he must have the
goatee. See [here](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h4xCSLl0L_M/Tuoepd3YEZI/AAAAAAAAMRY/oFwqSTR_XSw/s1600/spock.jpg)

But the true rule is "reverse-facial-hair" rule. If you have goatee in
this universe, then your evil twin must have no goatee in the other
universe. See Trek DS9.

That's right. We fast.

"On an otherwise slow news day for fuel cell stocks, Plug Power shook
up the market with an announcement that U.K.-based supermarket chain
Asda will be buying a "turnkey solution" for its warehouse forklift
fleet, including 'fuel cells, hydrogen fueling equipment, hydrogen and
service' from Plug"

When you are in 'Nam and Charlie is coming at you from all directions,
you need to conserve your ammo. You don't shoot until you see the
whites of their eyes. Very important. Charlie is smart. He'll come at
you but stop at a distance, right outside rifle range, he wants you to
shoot and waste your ammo. So you wait... You hold! UNTIL YOU SEE THE
WHITES OF THEIR EYES. Only then you shoot.

Good going Vietnam

"@wang_seaver

Yes, yes New Zealand is doing great on COVID.

But perhaps we can also spare some praise for, say, Vietnam? Vietnam
maintained a 99-day streak without community transmission of COVID-19,
and it has 19.5x the population, 15x the population density, and
1/15th the GDP/capita of NZ"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
