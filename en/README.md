Bloomberg: "Michelin Reinforces Bet on Hydrogen to Move Beyond Tires"

---

Hybrid btw fuel-cell and turbine? Cool.

This is what H2 brings to the table; flexibility, options.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Airbus are getting serious about Hydrogen Hybrid aircraft - burning H2 in gas turbines AND having electric motor inputs. Could be a clever use of Green H2 in the drive for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NetZero?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NetZero</a>. <a href="https://t.co/sWrbFJVUfb">https://t.co/sWrbFJVUfb</a></p>&mdash; Graham Hodgson (@GraHod) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraHod/status/1381578306525523973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

"France to ban some domestic flights where train available.. MPs vote
to suspend internal flights if the trip can be completed by train
within two and a half hours instead"

---

Talked abt that before; see the [South Korean](2018/06/guiding-regulation-south-korea.md)
example. It's the invisible hand approach, with a caveat, it is government's hand. ðŸ˜¶

"How can government push for faster Internet speeds?"

I am not saying make war, but if there was war, it wld not be good for Iran.

US power is over 100 times more than Iran's. Israel is way ahead of them too

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../../2020/07/gdpw.csv')
df = df[df['country'].isin(['United States','Iran','Israel']) ]
df['gdp'] = df.gdpcap * df.population
df['mb'] = (df.gdpcap * df.gdp)/1e14
print (df[['country','mb']])
```

```text
           country            mb
13   United States  12898.099255
31          Israel    145.850215
114           Iran     25.909706

Not true

"A war with Iran would be much, much harder than against Iraq"

"Churchill implored FDR to join the war", yes he did, and he [failed](https://youtu.be/kRzmpCE96kU).
FDR didnt listen to him. 

---

FDR did not want to fight in WWII. How do I know? Bcz he'd rather have
these monstrous "Liberty ships" built than send a single man to the
war.

Aha

(Same 3/3 ukrweekly link) "The previous day, Crimean Tatars held their
biggest rally at the peninsulaâ€™s parliamentary building in Simferopol
in support of a unitary Ukraine"

This is fun.. research by GDELT.. The dataset surely contains more
interesting info than a random tuber throwing a fit or even some MSM.

---

Interesting.. for March 3rd, GDELT found [this](http://www.ukrweekly.com/uwwp/ukraine-receives-additional-u-s-security-aid-while-biden-and-eu-prolong-russia-sanctions/)
and wrongly classified it as military escalation.. It is more like "cage rattling" though.

---

GDELT uses news web pages as raw source, applies natural lang
processing algos on them to extract Actor1-Action-Actor2 type "events"
for ex "Thailand warned South Africa", where diplomatic "warn" is the
action.. There are mistakes sometimes, when they occur, seem to be on
the false positive side -- event is extracted, but didnt really
happen. I had to go through every result one by one to filter out
such false positives.3

@PaulEremenko of @Universal_H2 was the former CTO of @Airbus?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
