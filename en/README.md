Covid wld strenghten EU's hand in Brexit. Whatever econ hit EU can

I still do not support nuclear bcz waste storage is problematic. Much,
much more problematic than carbon storage coming from fossil CCS.

Fossil companies can generate renewable fuel + carbon capture **at the
source**. Once produced, ship this clean fuel, and all the way down
the pipeline, the whole process is green. No pollution. H2 cannot emit
carbon at that point bcz there is no carbon in it. H2 pipeline
transmits clean, FC car uses it, water comes from its exhaust. I mean
it's comically clean.

Fracking still needs to be banned, for other reasons, not simply bcz
it is fossil. The waste water seeping into the ground, waste of
potable water, flaring, etc.

No support for wildlife refuge drilling.

In short, fossil business can be contained, while still generating
clean energy. The whole network needs to be updated for clean fuel,
diverse generation methods can provide energy to it. Preferable input
of course would be cleanest generation possible, e.g. solar, requiring
no CCS at the source.

Fighting climate change is not about "jobs".

It requires choosing the right tech.

Fossil fuels were a tech. Now it will be about a different kind of
tech.

Ok.. vaccines are on the way, great. But the whole process has been
excrucitingly slow. Vaccine arrival shld have happened in a few
months.

Was it bcz of massive privatization of drug development and research?
Companies excel at capitalizing on research funded by others but
little slow on the uptake when they have to RD something themselves?

"8/9/1664, New Amsterdam becomes New York..

Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant surrenders New Amsterdam, the capital
of New Netherland, to an English naval squadron under Colonel Richard
Nicolls. Stuyvesant had hoped to resist the English, but he was an
unpopular ruler, and his Dutch subjects refused to rally around
him. Following its capture, New Amsterdam?s name was changed to¬†New
York, in honor of the Duke of York, who organized the mission"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
