The filibuster was never in the constitution, originated mostly by
accident, and has historically been used to block civil rights. No
legislatures on earth have a supermajority requirement because that’s
stupid and paralyzing. It’s time to trash the Jim Crow filibuster"

I got vaccinated at the new FEMA site in Brooklyn today, and one thing
I didn’t expect was just how good it would feel seeing the kind of
mass public mobilization that’s been missing for the last year ...

The site is running like clockwork and just cranking through the
vaccinations, must've done hundreds in the 15 mins I was there. Was
staffed by a huge number of really delightful National Guard people
from all over the country - the people who gave me my shot were from
Georgia"

The unemployment measurement problem was known at the FED, among the
various branches, at highest levels. Another Komlos paper

talks about alternative measurements proposed by the officials
themselves over the years.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
