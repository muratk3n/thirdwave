The best way to see these "AI" products is as parrots. Like parrot can
speak, and make intelligable human-like sounds, and even say stuff on
occasion that seems to fit a certain mood, they cannot converse with
humans. These tools are trained with very specific aims in mind,
writing a story wld be a tough barrier to cross.

intelligence attempts to write a story. Author Daniel Kehlmann

Too good

"A senior Teen Vogue staffer who expressed concern about the racist
tweets posted by the magazine's now-departed editor used the N-word in
her own tweets. Christine Davitt, a senior social media manager at
Teen Vogue, wrote two tweets in 2009 to a friend identifying him as a
'ni--a,' and another in 2010 using the word 'ni--a'"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
