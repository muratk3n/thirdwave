An earlier [post](2014/02/is-earth-fked.md) on BW

"[A] geophysicist, Brad Werner, who in 2012 argued ... that we are in
this [climate] mess not because the market system is not working well
enough but because it is working too well. Werner’s startling
presentation to the annual conference of the American Geophysical
Union was titled ‘Is the Earth F**ked?’ and he posed in public the
question climate scientists and others who follow their work had been
asking in private... [He builds] on the fact that humans now
constitute a force of nature so powerful that we have caused the Earth
to enter a new geological epoch ... [We created] globally integrated
market system of resource-use and waste generation driven by the
relentless need to grow...

The essential problem, Werner argued, is that there is a mismatch
between the short time-scales of markets, and the political systems
tied to them, and the much longer time-scales that the Earth system
needs to accommodate human activity, including soaking up our carbon
dioxide and other wastes.

Technological progress and globalization of finance, transport and
communications have oiled the wheels of the human components of the
planetary system allowing it to speed up. But the pace of the natural
system carries on as it always has. The problem is not .. market
failure but market success"

Maybe they already know they are getting their "gray" energy from
Russia, with CCS done on their side

US has potential for both (but dont frack, or transmit NG over pipes,
they leak, very hard to regulate, Id also watch for
[this shit](2019/09/sf6.md), the material is used in wind turbines and
high-voltage electric installations)

"How is Europe more gung-ho on green energy production compared to
other countries?"

Dubya used that stuff so well.. I'll never forget during one debate
Gore was constantly saying "I'll fight for this","I'll fight for that"
W jumps in and he's like "there's been enough fightin". Boom. With a
little Southerner cowboy delivery, perfect timing.. Gore was
floored. Top notch salesmanship brother.

But the most obnoxious form of unity talk starts from the Washington
Consensus, post-politics mentality that emerged, a Frankenstein of the
post Berlin War, TINA world order. After the whole damn Berlin Wall
collapsed on their heads, Dems in abject fear started running around,
looked for a new place to go, lurched right, tried to outdo Reps in
their own game. Reps balked, and radicalized on 4G (Green, Gays, Guns,
God) to differentiate, so the Clinton years had insane amt of
drama. These issues were moral, ethical issues not political,
unresolvable at that level, so intense fighting persisted, became
entrenched. Hannity vs Maddow, people screaming at eachother,
theather, junk-food politics are all the descendants of that era.

Now into this environment, in the eleventh inning steps in a certain
politican and ask for, you guessed it, unity, comity. It can sell,
sure.. "Im a uniter not a divider" etc. But thinking of the causes,
for the Dems especially, we know they r in no position to ask for such
things because their leaving a major ideology unattended for years,
and trying to displace another is what caused the shitstorm to begin
with, not to mention Trump's rise.

A spin, on top of a big mistake, on top of a generational shift -now
defunct-... Meh. Not exactly FDR caliber.

Sometimes the use of the word is tactical, you mention unity, if the
other guy does not go for it, now he is the asshole. Small effect, but
maybe worth a try for some.

Sometimes it is used bcz pol has no inclination to deliver anyway, you
ask for unity, you dont get it, than you immediately blame the other
side as a cover for you not doing anything.

There cld be some old cultural aspects involved; we talked abt during
[Pemmican Wars](2018/09/pemmican.md) Brits had to step in and *merge*
two companies. If such things happened more than once, maybe it became
"the legitimate thing", "the grown up thing" in the eyes of the US
political class, persisted in its DNA, at the very least, as a
lip-service, verbally.

---

Here are some reasons unity, or "going bi" is eluded to so much in
US politics.

During a pandemic, after Trump, and in a country composed of states,
it is not that off-kilter to pay some lip service to the concept. Of
course the unity of states doesnt imply political unity, but hey, it
rhymes, good TV. It's a feel-good word, like marshmallows, chicken
soup, Sunday morning.. School is out. Whatever...

Unity.. that elusive wonderful thing..

Not bad... If there is less corp pandering, more left from AC, the bro
at CNN can be the new Fredo.

"Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that leading alternative
energy technology provider Plug Power Inc. will establish a $125
million Innovation Center in New York State creating 377 new jobs. The
center, located in the Town of Henrietta, Monroe County, will be the
first world's first Gigafactory for Proton Exchange Membrane
technology. The company will use this facility to manufacture hydrogen
fuel cell stacks and electrolyzers"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
