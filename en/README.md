Exclusive: Carter Centre to launch first-ever US election initiative,
citing 'erosion' of democracy in the country. The organisation,
founded by Carter, monitors elections in hotspots around the
world. This is the first time it has worked in the US"

"A single high-pressure system rolling in from the Southwest initiated
the heat wave and the thunderstorms, which together created the
conditions for the fires, which will likely both exacerbate and be
exacerbated by the pandemic, which has diminished firefighting
resources and, along with the heat wave, contributed to the blackouts
by keeping people at home with their air-conditioning on full
blast. These overlapping disasters compound"

Nice. And 19th century math isn't that bad. They had a lot of what's
there today.

Wolfram on Feynman: "Some scientists (myself probably included) are
driven by the ambition to build grand intellectual edifices. I think
Feynman—at least in the years I knew him—was much more driven by the
pure pleasure of actually doing the science. He seemed to like best to
spend his time figuring things out, and calculating. And he was a
great calculator. All around perhaps the best human calculator there's
ever been.

He always just used regular calculus and things. Essentially
nineteenth-century mathematics. He never trusted much else. But
wherever one could go with that, Feynman could go. Like no one else"

In the early day of modern physics they could probably recover $G$
from the small $g$. They knew the circumf of earth, so they could know
radius, a rough mass (from volume), u get small g through experiment
with dropping object etc, then $G = g r^2 / m_2$,

```python
m2 = 5.972e24 # kg
r = 6371000 # meters
g = 9.8
G = g*r**2 / m2
print (G)
```

A rough approx but usable.

Just watched another mobile home showcase video where the owner said
they installed solar panels, utilizing their setup at 30% capacity and
it was enough for them. There is so much unused solar potential.

Big development in the hearing so far: DeJoy has now committed to

treat election mail as marketing mail (slower) if it was mailed that
way"

"@ProfBrianCox

I stand by my prediction from months ago. Johnson will cave on almost
everything, as he did on the withdrawal agreement, because there is no
other option. He should extend the transition, but he won’t. He will
need a face saving headline and that will be something to do with fish"

Glad PySPH is there, but they do code generation, too reliant on
`cython`. I am almost certain they could gain the same speed with
`numba` wout code gen.

Also MayaVi usage is obtuse.

The "Hello World" app for SPH is dam break. Gotta get that done,
simply.

Mathematicians knew things other the Calculus then; advanced
polynomials, power series, geometry and how to use all of that for
planetary calc. I doubt regular Calc student can do any of that today.

The tweet is essentially pitting Isaac Freaking Newton against any
student who knows Calculus. IN would clean their clock. Any good
mathmatician of that era would too.

"@AnalysisFact

Once you learn calculus, you've caught up to what was the cutting edge
of math in 1687"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
