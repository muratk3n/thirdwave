"The Dfinity Foundation today announced the commercial launch of the
Internet Computer. It has an ambitious goal: to become humanity‚Äôs
primary compute platform for building the software‚Äîincluding
decentralized versions of Linkedin, TikTok, and WhatsApp‚Äîthat will
change the way the world works.

After five years in development, and a $102 million raise from
investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, the
much-anticipated project is finally launching, alongside a utility
token, ICP‚Äîwhich will list directly on Coinbase, and an intriguing new
identity solution"

Imagine a world without ever needing a username and password or
touching cryptographic key material. Where users are no longer tracked
across internet services, and where managing your online identity is
easier and safer than it is today"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
