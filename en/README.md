My youngest hacked our Netflix parental code. She put light grease on
the remote and got me to input the code when she wasn’t looking. Then
she noted the numbers I’d pressed and went through the combinations
later. I’m both frightened and impressed"

"@alexdante

we rightly get outraged at the heartless ghouls who want to sacrifice
lives for their stonks but we should definitely reserve some of that
for the absolute moral black holes who are angrily demanding
everything re-open because they're missing their sportsballs"

Contradiction, again... Bernie's entire candidacy was about left being
more distint from the right. 

"I supported Bernie during the 2020 primary"

"I dont want strong divisions between parties"

I maintain that whatever delusions they might have, on gold, the world
order, libertards (distinct right) should be in charge of the
Republican Party. I shared this previously in a tweet;

>It is illegal to inhabit a tiny home in most populated areas of
>the U.S. The housing industry and the banks sustaining it spent much
>of the 1970s and 1980s pushing for larger houses to produce more
>profit per structure

Would this happen under a libertard? They are for any kind of
commerce, large or small, right? There you go, even a goldcuck could
fix some problems in US where corporatist sluts **create** them.

---

These are a contradiction in terms. If you want strong ideology on
your side (as you should), you should accept it on the other side as
well.  Maybe Lyin Ted is the wrong guy for that, who knows, his father
killed JFK and his wife is ugly, but on principle someone with strong
convictions should be acceptable.

"I want strong, distinct left"

"I don't want an ideologue on the Rep side like Ted Cruz"

Rules of supply-demand does not apply to US dollar in the
international arena. This is the part libertards dont understand. They
think increased supply = less price. But dollar is in demand bcz of US
backing it militarily, and ppl need it to do other things with it, not
bcz of some intrinsic value and price has to reflect the balance
demand / supply on that "value".

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
