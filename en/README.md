Jeans: "Mathematical analysis shows that if the centre of a star is
either liquid, or partially so, there is no danger of collapse; the
liquid center provides so firm a basis for the star, as to render the
collapse impossible".

The radiation part of that story is crooked to begin with. In terms of
condensed matter, which is more likely for stars, they
[cannot collapse](https://youtu.be/cHGT0DgvhNM?t=79) on themselves,
James Jeans admitted this, in 1933 (see vid). Black hole theory has
too many holes (!).

"When old star die their core collapses forming black holes"

Gases cannot act like blackbodies. Now take the next natural step and
admit stars are made up of solids.

Is cosmology science? Effin Astrology has better science than you

"Stars (which are dense balls of hot gas) also behave like blackbodies"

'Scraping' means having a program visit a page and take its raw data,
leaving behind the visual elements.. so it's like scraping paint off a
wall.

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
df = pd.read_csv('gfp-2021.csv')
df = df[df.country.isin(['USA','Russia'])]
print (df['Submarines'])
```

```text
0     68.0
46    64.0
Name: Submarines, dtype: float64

For military comparisons see [Global Firepower](https://www.globalfirepower.com/).
I scraped their site, [someone else](https://github.com/prasertcbs/basic-dataset/tree/master/GlobalFirePower)
did 2017, both versions are below in CSV format

[2017](tweets/2021/gfp-2017.csv)
[2021](tweets/2021/gfp-2021.csv)

Comparing both years cld be interesting. Did military budgets increase
or decrease for country X?

I am pretty sure if there was a Greece-TR war, GR could manage to
tie.. In every metric I look at, innovation, GII, military hardware,
two countries are close. GDP/PerCap is in the same class basically
which is decidedly lightweight. Sameness on many fronts is another
indication of ppl / gov similarities, and that Anatolians belong to
where they live, not bunch of ragged punks from whereever.

The fact that Taiwan is a natural fortress makes u think, people live
in these places and its probably for a good reason.. there is a
natural selection of locales?

Falcon, WSold not bad.. Takes place after the 1/2 humanity
disappearance was restored (another movie), and it looks like they are
using that event as parallel to a post covid world, talks of
restoration, etc. Show wasnt cuck, didnt use wormholes, time travel,
multiverse, so far. Solid sci can give enough fi, see.

Snyder Cut JL, better than the prev version. Storylines make more
sense. It is long tho.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
