Why is the use of renewable fuel, even if produced from fossil,
preferable?

Easier enforcement.

Fossil fuel at the end-user can leak, emission more likely. Carmakers
can cheat (see the Volkswagen 2015 scandal).

But if gov encourages, enforces clean fuel production at the source,
even with CCS, or even better 100% clean production, then all the way
down the line, beginning, middle, the end, we know there can be no
leaks, no emissions. No need to police Volkswagen, or Honda, Toyota,
etc. their fuel-cell car will have no choice but be clean.

Of course regulatory arbitrage and the pushback to it, i.e.
level-playing field, is more of an issue for UK bcz of its closeness
to the EU, in terms of geo.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
