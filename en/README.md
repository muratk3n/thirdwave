Still a well-made show, good story telling

Earth being a shithole in The Expanse is a bit of a stretch. They have
UBI, an atmosphere, can grow stuff and by then god knows what. So
they'd still be 1000 times better off than any comparable nearby
planet, rock. Even if underwater u'd sooner develop gills to adapt to
that than the bone structure to live on Mars.

All this reminds me the 2007 Time Person of the Year. What happened
since?

Need to be wary with "crashing the gates" mentality.. Back in 90s, u
could have that feling about "the Internet" battling retail giants,
Walmart. The most representative of the era, Amazon, is now another
retail giant, another corporation that people complain about in
similar ways.

"Robinhood giveth, then it taketh away. Hurt one hedge fund, and unless
you take the entire system down with it, a Citadel Securities will
make sure it grows back. Theyâ€™re all part of the same organism. "This
makes capitalism very much like the Thing in John Carpenterâ€™s film of
the same name: a monstrous, infinitely plastic entity, capable of
metabolizing and absorbing anything with which it comes into contact,'"

"This isn't the exciting, hilarious answer you want, but a lot of
people had no idea it was even happening until the past 48 hours, and
even now, it's mostly just a funny news article about some internet
trolls making a bubble... As much as young people on the internet like
to imagine this as an epic, David vs Goliath, Wall Street vs Main
Street showdown for the history books, from a bird's eye view it's
actually just a brief dumpster fire"

While in US back in the day when I noticed fitness degrad, I
researched little and came upon Montignac, the French diatician. His
method worked brilliantly; he talked abt same issues that are
mainstream now. I had a few coworkers lose weight through the method too..

What were the highlights from the DW documentary on junk food?

Michelle Obama had a genuine effort started to decrease childhood
obesity, but it was hijacked by corps and the message was diverted
into exercise (Raj Patel has some colorful comments here), fun and
dancing were emphasized and it was swarmed by showbiz people. That
switch wld not help, as u need better eating than exercise.

I now have this nagging feeling that the big exercise movements of
80/90s were a result of misplaced hope, or straight up media
manipulation. People were gradually getting worse but did not know
why, they shld have been led towards better eating, but the message
was corrupted, diverted to exercise. More muscles, more running etc.

How it started: During 70s the silent killer was heart attack. It was
determined "fat" was the culprit, so the fight was on. Fat had to be
removed. But when food producers took the fat out they replaced it
with something worse.. sugar. Fat alone cannot cause excessive weight
gain, sugar has to act as catalyst.

Producer of "sugared drinks" which essentially what Coca Cola is, had
a field day. Through globalization they also reached broader
markets. Through NAFTA for example they had freer access to Mexico and
coupled with other "invasions" the Mexican diet worsened, became more
artificial and sweeter, the effects were immediate, they became less
healthier, fatter. Two NGO lawyers fought to add a tax on sugared food
and drinks, they won; afterwards obesity decreased substantially.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
