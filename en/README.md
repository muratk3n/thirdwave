So if you are really smart about the design of the interlocking parts,
how big of a thing could you 3D print in pieces in a medium size
printer? I wonder... ü§î

Now dat I have full-blown Linux, in the large and small, I can go back

Luo Huining, aka The Butcher of Tibet, was sanctioned with Carrie
Lam(b) by the United States yesterday. He and his family may no longer
travel, own property, or show their faces in the US. He should be
brought up on war crimes charges for his actions In Tibet. The
belligerence of china‚Äôs wolf propagandists continues to bring comedy
to diplomacy. Did they think there wouldn‚Äôt be consequences to the
abrogation of their contract with the US and the UK? Communism‚Äôs rise
will be met with crippling sanctions that will subdue...

The economic growth and prosperity that existed under a democracy that
was governed under English law. We have the upper hand as the world
doesn‚Äôt trust china or its Monopoly money and closed capital
account. They have an exposed Achilles heel and the world is
aware"

"Germany has declared the Belgian port city a 'high-risk area.' For
more than a week, Antwerp has been trying to lower infections ‚Äì with
curfews and a new established coronavirus test center"

China at least partially blocks Whatsapp Telegram FB Messenger,
Instagram Twitter, Skype etc so basically all conversations with
people in China are concentrated on WeChat, mostly out of convenience
but also by government mandate. Conversely it now becomes an Achilles
heel"

Github contributor is reworking some images. This guy's a f-ing
machine. Receiving a pull request soon.

No need for usb cables for photo transfers.. Labtop "on the LAN", with
a little `scp`, after `termux-setup-storage`, phone can send over
files. From well-known dir to another well-known dir, alias it, so it
can be touchscreen typed on phone.

Google apparently has completely cornered the market on driver assist
/ navigation. All TR cabbies are on it.

Telling ya, Titan is the shit. Or O'Neil cylinders.

Apparently A. C. Clarke‚Äôs novel *Imperial Earth* has some good info.

Movie idea, ppl leave Earth in spaceship ready to settle, escaping
apocalyptic scenario, land on Mars and then they are like 'dude it
sucks here let's go back', and they return, use all the tools on
Earth. So it's a very roundbout style of scifi, indirect.

"[T]here is almost nothing that could happen to earth that would make
it less hospitable than Mars. Whether it‚Äôs nuclear war or massive
global warming, post disaster earth would be way more habitable than
Mars"

Dude the *consigliere* as the space hero? No. I understand they tried

*Armageddon*. \#deepimpact

Hah. I guess that should tell you how Americans want to be governed,
Scotus judges are not even elected by the people, they are appointed
by people who are elected by the people. So they are **twice** removed
from the public üò∂

"Gallup found that Americans [largely] approved of the [SCOTUS]
justices‚Äô performance"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
