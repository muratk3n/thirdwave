Managing ISR must be like dealing with an infant 

---

Not making a public spat with ISR probably made sense. Publicly
shitting on them cld push the muckers to more attacks.. The 2014
"conflict" lasted for 50 days after all, Biden surely remembered that.

Noticed that myself.. cld be significant

The Atlantic: "In a conflict where words matter (so much so that even
using the word conflict invites disagreement), itâ€™s notable when the
words used begin to change.. a subtle, and perhaps more revealing,
shift has come from the White House.. In an address announcing
yesterdayâ€™s cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, President Joe Biden
said, 'Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and
securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and
democracy'"

"Robert Redfield, director of the [CDC, himself a scientist] under
Trump, recently said he believes that a lab leak is the most likely
explanation of how the pandemic started"

---

"You cannot make sense of the firmness with which the lab leak
hypothesis was dismissed without appreciating how Trump changed
American media. After the 2016 election, the top tier of American
media traded objectivity for opposition. As the New York Times has
more or less admitted, normal standards no longer applied. Success was
now defined by the extent to which you made Donald Trumpâ€™s life
difficult"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
