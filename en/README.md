No wonder, under the crust there is magma, at 1000° C degrees, only
the Sun itself is hotter (5000° C). Hell the inner Earth core is as
hot as the Sun! So theoretically it is unlimited energy. Challanges
are drilling, finding pockets close enough.

"Geothermal power has considerable potential for growth. The amount of
heat within 10 000 metres of the earth's surface is estimated to
contain 50 000 times more energy than all oil and gas resources
worldwide (Shere, 2013). Moreover, there is a strong economic case for
the deployment of geothermal energy"

Crypto mining is there to encourage people to share their computing
resources with the network right? First of all, Nano proved you can
have a crypto without mining, but, let's say for it's nice to have a computing
resources for additional services. Then, wouldnt a computing environment
that promises constant availability of such resource be a better fit for
a crypto? I am thinking of DFinity Internet Computer now. A crypto would
be just another app for this platform.

Man geo mapping with some tools is a pain in the ass.. Leaflet.js is a

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
