More objections to the [Booch](https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1475) article. 
Map / Reduce was a relatively recent invention, it's not merely "machine learning"
it was a new, innovative way of parallelization of all data processing.

On the language front, 'we dont have sexy langs etc', but for IT,
where you are just shifting bytes around and not computing much, that
might not be a big loss. I mean how many different ways can you create
a f-ing list? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The work isnt all that challenging, outside scale,
systems and some project management areas. Booch should know otherwise
he wouldnt spend all that time with his boxes and arrows in his
so-called methodalogies

"The data .. suggest [tax avoidance banning] efforts have been mostly
unsuccessful. The share of US firms‚Äô profits booked in low-tax locales
keeps growing year after year as depicted in Figure 4.2. The evidence
is less comprehensive for non-US multinationals because the available
data cover fewer years, but the trend seems to be the same. How can we
explain this lack of success? The BEPS initiative does not attack the
heart of the tax-dodging reactor. Firms are still supposed to exchange
goods, services, and assets internally. The Big Four still manufacture
transactions that have no market price. Transfer pricing accountants
still have incentives to please their clients and certify as correct
whatever arrangement will minimize their tax bill. In need of a
Copernican revolution, we‚Äôve been busy refining the Ptolemaic model of
the heavens"

"[T]he New Deal [is] perhaps the most progressive in world history. As
we saw, it successfully taxed the wealthy for more than three
decades‚Äînot only on paper, but in actual fact. By design, few people
paid the 80%‚Äì90% top marginal income tax rates that prevailed from the
1930s through to the 1970s. But, all taxes included, effective tax
rates for the very affluent exceeded 50%. Tax dodging was kept in
check. ...[FDR] also spent time explaining why taxes mattered,
appealing to morality, and shunning tax dodgers. 'Mr. Justice Holmes
said, "Taxes are what we pay for civilized society" [the words
inscribed above the entrance to the headquarters of the Internal
Revenue Service in Washington, DC]. Too many individuals, however,
want the civilization at a discount.'"

As Roosevelt‚Äôs message to Congress expresses clearly, the
quasi-confiscatory top marginal income tax rates championed by the
United States were designed to reduce inequality, not to collect
revenue. Why would anyone try to earn more than a million dollars if
all of that extra income went to the IRS? No employment contract with
a salary above a million would ever be signed. Nobody would amass
enough wealth to receive more than a million in annual capital
income. The rich would stop saving after they reached that point. They
most likely would give their assets to heirs or charities once they
surpassed the threshold.

"Since our most recent update September 2019, there has been a lot of
progress in fuel cells for shipping applications. Below is an update
on where fuel cells in shipping has progressed since our last update..

In November 2020, Doosan Fuel Cell announced it will be manufacturing
SOFCs to power and propel ships built by Singaporean shipping company
Navig8. The partnership will initially power a 50,000-ton
ship. According to Doosan, Navig8 has around 140 global petrochemical
and oil carriers that could potentially be decarbonized through the
use of Doosan‚Äôs SOFCs"

"Documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday show the Wuhan Institute of
Virology undertook¬†coronavirus¬†experiments on mammals captured more
than 1,000 miles away in Yunnan ‚Äì funded by a $3.7 million grant from
the US government. ..

Senior Government sources said that while 'the balance of scientific
advice' was still that the deadly virus was first transmitted to
humans from a live animal market in Wuhan, an accident at the
laboratory in the Chinese city was 'no longer being discounted'"

That young Congressman died just days before widespread vaccine

"Dfinity is building what it calls the internet computer, a
decentralized technology spread across a network of independent data
centers that allows software to run anywhere on the internet rather
than in server farms that are increasingly controlled by large firms,
such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. This week Dfinity is
releasing its software to third-party developers, who it hopes will
start making the internet computer‚Äôs killer apps. It is planning a
public release later this year.

Rewinding the internet is not about nostalgia. The dominance of a few
companies, and the ad-tech industry that supports them, has distorted
the way we communicate‚Äîpulling public discourse into a gravity well of
hate speech and misinformation‚Äîand upended basic norms of
privacy. There are few places online beyond the reach of these tech
giants, and few apps or services that thrive outside of their
ecosystems"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
