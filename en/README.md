Similar news all around the world. Even travelers also buy RV to avoid
crowded hotels. This is good; it'll encourage more self-sustaining,
off-the-grid, mobile living.

"RV dealers around Australia are reporting a post-lockdown sales spike,
as more Australians look to buy a caravan and holiday locally rather
than travel overseas"

"@JoshABlock

It’s unsurprising—but still noteworthy—how smoothly 2A extremists
shifted from fantasies of self defense against a tyrannical government
to fantasies of assisting police in using force against other
civilians"

See *ST Voyager* V. Conspiracy ep; it was all about false

Once upon a time u cld get a prescient take on a social issue through

"Excessive surveillance often backfires in this way. We saw it happen
after the surveillance surge in many countries following 9/11. As
terrible as it is, Islamic terrorism is, thankfully, a rare event in
Western societies. It is perpetrated by small numbers of extremists,
who often know one another from their families or neighborhoods. That
makes them hard to identify through Big Data methods, which are good
for identifying sweeping, structural patterns, not for accurately
finding needles in haystacks—especially when those needles live near
one another, can easily avoid digital tools, or merely speak a
language that’s not commonly understood by law enforcement.

And broad surveillance can engender a chilling effect among the whole
populace, making people less willing to express their political views
online. Worse, using Big Data for rare events leads to the problem of
false positives. When no clear identifying and strong signal is
exclusive to the real but anomalous terrorists, the system will pick
up lots of non-terrorists as suspicious, wasting the time of law
enforcement in the process. You can imagine that the FBI must have had
better things to do than visit random people who had purchased
pressure cookers and backpacks at the same time, but that’s what
happened after two brothers used those items—putting homemade
pressure-cooker bombs in backpacks—to attack the Boston Marathon in
2013"

Excellent episode. That's what made Trek great, It wasnt abt the
technobabble really, it was the hard-core anthropology-fi, and working
of tech into social takes

Scihub allows free access to academic papers. With publicly funded
papers walled off, ppl cant understand why they should pay for papers
they are not even sure they will use. Hence existing system is largely
being circumvented.

"@Gassensmith

99% of sci-hubs traffic is probably people at home that do not want to
deal with their organization's byzantine VPN technology and expired
security certificates to download the paper legally"

1934 Pogoms of Thrace.. Took place in so-called Turkey after which
many Jews left due to harrassement..

Interesting time period. I used to know someone from Tekirdag (in
Thrace) who had learned tailoring trade from Jews, then during 40s
became obscenely rich from it. Now Im thinking, maybe all Jewish
tailors were gone by then and he was the only game in town. Tailor's
lastname; TurkSoldier (u cant make this up).

"@pwcdanica

It's wild to see anyone argue against banning no-knock search warrants
in the name of public safety when that's exactly what led to police
murdering Breonna Taylor. Murdering a civilian in her own home is the
opposite of public safety. You don't get to eff that up again. No
more"

"In a speech on Friday marking 150 years of the French Republic,
President Emmanuel Macron criticised those who seek French citizenship
without accepting France’s 'right to commit blasphemy'. To be French,
he said, is to defend the right to 'laugh, to criticise, to mock'"

It seems blacks would be more motivated to go out and vote, and vote
against the incumb, than whites would be for Trump.

"'Guys are tired,' the Oklahoma City guard Chris Paul said in an
interview. 'When I say tired, I don’t mean physically tired. We’re
tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. It’s emotional,
especially when you’re a Black man. We’re all hurt. Everybody expects
us to be okay because we get paid great money. We’re humans. We have
real feelings.' These players can’t just 'stick to sports.' Not when
their lives are on the line, when their communities are
disproportionately dying of COVID-19 and police violence, or bearing
the brunt of joblessness and evictions"

"The Milwaukee Bucks hadn’t planned on becoming activists. They
brought basketball to a halt in a messy but honest way, recognizing
the absurdity of playing sports in isolated luxury in the middle of a
pandemic, all for a chance at bringing an NBA championship trophy home
to a city 40 miles north of where Blake was shot as his children
watched"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
