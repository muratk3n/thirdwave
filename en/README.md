"@ChrisMurphyCT

The careful, purposeful steps @BernieSanders has taken to bring the
party together this spring and summer will be a huge part of the story
we tell when @JoeBiden wins"

The marketing around the "Google Killer" Wolfram Alfa was mostly bunk
tho.. SW goes back and forth being ignored and posturing
needlessly...

He is a serious scientist, no doubt there.

---

Our uni legend had it one our CS profs, my Alg I teacher as it turns
out, had code in Mathematica. He worked with SW's ppl I think. During
lecture he'd slip up sometimes and say "cellular automata" when it was
totally unrelated so we guessed this was his area of research.

---

Stephen Wolfram might have something going on; starting from
computation, emergent physics cld be possible.. You hear things abt
his group over the years, one mathematician I know stumbled upon an
invention that had to do solving PDEs using cellular automata, and he
was jumped on by Wolfram's people, even threathening legal action for
a patent issue?  Anyway, u gotta be wary of these kind of
motherfonkers tucked away somewhere toiling away on an arcane
knowhow.. They might just stumble upon the real thing -- 42.

Monaghan, founder of SPH is from Monash U? Some good science coming
out of Oz!

Sad. And I am laughing.

"The momentum from both stalwart players like Cummins and upstarts like
Nikola to deploy zero-emission Class 8 trucks comes as regulators
begin the march toward mandating that a certain percentage of trucks
sold each year produce no emissions. The California Air Resources
Board made history in June by announcing that OEMs will be required to
begin selling zero-emission commercial trucks and vans in 2024"

"RONN Motor Group, today announced the anticipated 2022 release of its
new Hydrogen Fuel Cell SUV the “Myst”, named for the fact the only

vapor. ... Engineered in the United States by a team of automotive
industry experts"

They are talking about merely compiling BTW (creating executable
code), not even running that code and checking the result.

"Repeatability in Computer Science.. Only 1/3rd of code could be built"

I guess that makes sense, elastic body cld be seen as fluid with a few
constants changed.

Solids are fluids that dont move much?

Or elasticity is left-over fluidicity in solids?

See I like that. Saying more with less. 

---

Shit - SPH can do elastic dynamics too?

Glamping, hah.

They microwave poo, burning it essentially. 

"@scion_research

After 5 years developing, designing, building and testing prototypes,
our team have demonstrated their toilet technology concept works. It
uses a process called sub-critical wet-oxidation, engaging heat &
oxygen to kill pathogens & breakdown solids"

This guy goes around and showcases tiny houses around the world

Tiny house movement is growing. People convert cargo containers etc
for living space, create simple environment, mostly off the grid,
self-reliant (energy from solar or from fuel stored nearby).

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
