This tweet was liked by some tax-reform advocates I noticed

"@KClausing

Update: Sworn in today as deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis
in Treasury. Tax policy is a key tool for tackling our biggest
challenges, incl. pandemic relief & recovery, climate change, and
inequality. Grateful to be part of Biden policy team!  Fired up and
ready to go"

reshuffle.. nice

"@poppymcp

Chinese media calls the military coup in Myanmar and replacement of
officials with army men a 'major cabinet reshuffle'"

That part is embarrasing.. R paper
[says](2021/01/kirchoff-sun-bigbang.md#bigbang) they most likely
measured Earth's own (nearby) oceans and mistook that for the Big
Bang. D'oh!

"If they did not measure the radiation from Big Bang what did they measure?"

But better, more accurate term wld have been just nonlinear regression
(for these recent neural nets that created most of the hype)

Why the switch..? The label "Machine Learning" was just fine..

The word AI has been so sullied by existing state-of-art, now movies
have to get away from it to sound cool. Convo from *Outside the Wire*,

A: "So, what are you? Like, AI?"

B: "Your cell phone's AI. A Gump's AI"

.. as in he is something else, not some trick code that recommends you
the shoe you just bought.

"New measures of success needed to avoid catastrophic breakdown,
landmark review finds. ... The world is being put at 'extreme risk' by
the failure of economics to take account of the rapid depletion of the
natural world and needs to find new measures of success to avoid a
catastrophic breakdown... Prosperity was coming at a 'devastating
cost' to the ecosystems that provide humanity with food, water and
clean air, said Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta, the Cambridge University
economist who conducted the review. Radical global changes to
production, consumption, finance and education were urgently needed"

More from Jack Brouwer, professor at UCI, director of the NFCRC, APEP

"If you want to go to all the way to zero emissions meeting, providing
a zero emissions option to a large apartment complex is not possible
with battery electric vehicles, because we can’t put new charging
stations at every one of the parking spots that this apartment complex
has without, like, tripling the electric infrastructure that goes into
that apartment complex. However, one hydrogen fueling station on the
corner would be able to serve that entire complex at a much lower cost"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
