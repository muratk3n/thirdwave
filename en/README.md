The real looting in America is the Walton family becoming $63 billion
richer during a pandemic, while paying wages so low that 14,541 of
their workers in 9 states need food stamps - all subsidized by
U.S. taxpayers. Yes. The Walton family is the real welfare queen in
America"

Pompeo stayed loyal to Trump, even with this election stuff, then
after the election loss he made a huge intl trip visiting places in a
way that would appeal the evangelicals. F24 is suggesting he is
planning a 2024 run. He can get the one-time Trump voters and
religious right.

What happens when people stop subscribing to print newspapers and
everyone buys everything online: 'Corrugated cardboard makes up as
much as a third of the paper entering recycling plants from homes in
big metro areas, up from 5% a few years ago.'"

200 years ago, the average American ate only 2 lbs. of sugar a
year. Today, the average American consumes 156 lbs of sugar in one
year. This is equal to 3 pounds a week"

Russian media is busy with an idea that dipshits in Tiggerland became
Britain's playthings in a Great Game Part II (albeit with less "great"
actors such as the UK). They are being used to bother / disturb the
Russia, EU, Greece, even Cyprus for the fear that if things calmed
down there the local UK bases would be called into
question. Interesting theory.

"@davidalanlevine

This is an important message that bears repeating. Politicizing
\#electionsecurity makes it harder to secure our elections and more
difficult to counter foreign efforts to interfere in them"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
