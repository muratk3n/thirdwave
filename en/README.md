"With heating and cooling in buildings responsible for 40% of energy
consumption and 36% of emissions, the importance of its
decarbonisation is paramount. As the current annual renovation rate is
below 1% and more than 70% of heating in buildings is supplied by old
and inefficient boilers, buildings are unanimously recognised as a
hard-to-decarbonise sector...

Direct electrification with heat pumps is not always economically
feasible in every building and will double the peak demand for
electricity in winter in most European countries... The town of
Hassfurt in Germany demonstrates how a cogeneration unit running on
hydrogen can be at the centre of the city’s long-term decarbonisation
strategy"

The Pacific has its own royals now..  Canada can dump UK ones and form
its own CommonWealth (Calif, WA, Canada, whats the difference). Add
the US, u have modern pre-modern/empire for the Pacific. H&M can be
Duke and Duchess of O.C.

Oz, NZ could join the New CW.

I wonder if TV anchors get a mood warning before they start reading

fast and u cld roll into a sad story smiling like a jackass. Warning
could help here.

US was "diverted" away from Info-Pacific [20 yrs ago](2019/11/americas-secret-war-friedman.md#china).
They are likely more intent to engage this time around.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
