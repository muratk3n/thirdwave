*The Guardian*: "The sky was the muddy yellow of an old bruise at 7am
inÂ San FranciscoÂ on Wednesday, and by eight it was a dull orange and
the darkness that felt like night was coming on. This morning was
perhaps the most unnatural-feeling and unnerving of my life, with
darkness rather than daytime rolling in. People around California
reported that the birds that would normally be singing were silent ...

What is happening now is astonishingly worse than the western fire
season ever has been before. There are catastrophic fires in Oregon
â€“burning down a small town and prompting the evacuation of much of the
small city of Medford. Near Oroville in northeastern California, a
fire expanded by a quarter million acres in 24 hours,Â so far as the
experts can tell. That is a new kind of fire and we are in a new kind
of era. ...

I have lived in San Francisco all my adult life, which has meant
living in relationship to the Pacific and its damp cool breath in the
form of our famous fog. Often in summertime the rising heat inland
sucks the cool air off the ocean in the form of fog ...

Here the ocean is a beloved ally, bringing us cool fresh clean airâ€”and
most of our weather comes from over the Pacific â€“ but we are not the
oceanâ€™s ally: the worldâ€™s oceans have soaked up most of the heat
climate change has produced, with disastrous consequences"

"@SevaUT

who said something like: if you can point to a single battle as the
cause of an empire?s downfall, you really ought to ask how the fate of
an empire came to hinge on a single battle"

Who was that tough guy on that Serbia / Kosova "deal" press conference
who kept saying "outsider perspective", "untried" was provided for
this issue..? Has the problem been solved or not? Or did US get
another photo op, few seconds soundbyte on that day's news cycle?

"Serbia will not fulfill its promise to move its embassy to Jerusalem
if Israel recognizes its enemy Kosovo, a source close to the
government in Belgrade warned Wednesday, adding that formal
recognition of Pristinaâ€™s 2008 declaration of independence by Israel
would 'destroy' the Jewish stateâ€™s relationship with Serbia"

If that's a problem, then don't crowd in cities 

Ineffective from a pandemic POV as well..

Its called the United States, not United Cities.

Giving landmass more of a weight is absolutely the right thing to
do. Electoral Collage is smart. More democratic even, bcz different
regions have different needs. What better way to balance those needs
than to spread out representation as wide, regionally, as possible,
throught the EC?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
