late 1970s is the most important driver of the increase in wealth
inequality since then'"

Yes, bcz the instruction set is simpler, but then bunch of companies
jumped on the bandwagon bcz the clean design, and it snowballed from
there.

"In two new studies, researchers have used microwaves to produce
hydrogen from plastic waste and water, respectively. ... 

In the new process, the researchers pulverize plastic in a kitchen
blender, mix it with a catalyst made of iron oxide and aluminum oxide,
and then zap it with microwaves at 1000 Watts. The microwaves trigger
the catalyst particles to strip over 97 percent of the hydrogen from
plastic in seconds"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
