*The Atlantic*: "By the end of March, Mina had identified a culprit:
'There‚Äôs little ability for a central command unit to pool all the
resources from around the country,' he said at a Harvard event. 'We
have no way to centralize things in this country short of declaring
martial law.' It took several more months for him to find a solution
to this problem, which is to circumvent it altogether. In the past
several weeks, he has become an evangelist for a total revolution in
how the U.S. controls the pandemic. Instead of restructuring daily
life around the American way of testing, he argues, the country should
build testing into the American way of life. The wand that will
accomplish this feat is a thin paper. It is a coronavirus test.

Mina says that the U.S. should mass-produce these inexpensive and
relatively insensitive tests‚Äîunlike other methods, they require only a
saliva sample‚Äîin quantities of tens of millions a day. These tests,
which can deliver a result in 15 minutes or less, should then become a
ubiquitous part of daily life .. The tests Mina describes already
exist: They are sitting in the office of e25 Bio, a small start-up in
Cambridge, Massachusetts; half a dozen other companies are working on
similar products"

Truman was **not** a simple farmer. Politicians might allow such
things to be said abt themselves or even help spread the commentsary
thinking it'll help their "man of the people" image. But reality is
different. Truman had much experience before he became
President. County judge, Civil Works admin, Senator, worked at a
high-profile commitee, Vice President, *then* Potus.

"But anyone can serve at the highest office look at Truman he was a
simple farmer"

Apparently it is becoming a thing in Thailand

That's funny

"A prominent student protest leader in Thailand has been arrested on
charges of sedition as pro-democracy rallies continued across the
country.Parit Chiwarak, 22, whose arrest was livestreamed on social
media, was stopped on the outskirts of Bangkok on Friday night. As he
was physically carried into a car, he raised his hand in a
three-fingered salute ‚Äì a gesture borrowed from the Hunger Games that
is used by protesters and symbolises opposition to the military-backed
government"

"'What I‚Äôve noticed is that, as opposed to everything I‚Äôve done my
entire career, the biggest difference is that in the future there will
be no lines on the battlefield,' Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the
[JCS], said.... Hyten who will be a keynote speaker at September‚Äôs
Defense News Conference ‚Äî laid out a vision in which every force can
both defend itself and have a deep-strike capability to hold an enemy
at bay, built around a unified command-and-control system.

'A naval force can defend itself or strike deep. An air force can
defend itself or strike deep. The Marines can defend itself or strike
deep,' he said. 'Everybody.'

That 'everybody' includes international partners, Hyten added, as the
U.S. operates so often in a coalition framework that this plan only
works if it can integrate others"

"Arab League blasts Turkey's cross-border operations into Iraq"

If the "outside countries" want to help, maybe they check their
actions as to not force the core ME to act this way.

"[UAE actions are] unfair and bitter for the Palestinians.¬†But it
corresponds to an irreversible trend: It is¬†no longer Israel¬†, but
above all Iran and¬†increasingly also Turkey¬†that are perceived by many
Arab states as dangerous 'intruders' in their own region"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
