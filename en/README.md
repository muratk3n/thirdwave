"[EU and Canada traded] nearly $165 billion worth of goods and services
flowed between us last year"

"As it stands, the U.K. exports and imports goods and services worth
just over ¬£1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) a year [with the EU]"

---

Neither Canada or Australia are good comparisons for UK / EU trade.

Power calc comes from

$P = \frac{d W}{d t} = F \cdot \frac{d s}{d t} = F \cdot v$

Multiply force with speed, get power. Driving uphill is hardest part,
fighting against a portion of grav. I left out acceleration to that
speed, left out friction, air resist.

Haha.. I am getting good at this.. someone said my kid has Power
Wheels, and I check out its battery, 12 V, 30 Amp = 360 Watts power,
how much power for uphill drive?


```python
m = 40+40 # car, kid
v = 10/3.6 # 10 km/h
print (int(m*9.8*np.sin(np.deg2rad(20))*v), 'Watt')
```

```text
744 Watt
```

Calc says this thing wont even drive uphill at modest speed.

Then I see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiNARVZQopk&t=320s) video.

Oh yeah, totally killed that shit

Good one 

"Had a colleague with PhD in solid mechanics, and he worked for
sometime on Computational Fluid Dynamics at a company, and was finally
entrusted with quality work at a SW dev Company. ...The joke was
'after working in solid and fluid, his work was all gas now'"

So they say Mark Cuban is now China's bitch?

You did not work a million times more than the next guy.

You probably aren't that smart either.

You are likely a one-trick pony which fit to the backdrop of the
current shit sandwich that is called "the system", that's
all. 

"But I worked hard for my billions, I am smart, I deserve them"

Billion level wealth creates power disparities in society. Take that
shit gov. Without regard to what you do with that money
later. Zero-sum. Gov wins, other side loses.

"Billionaire: Why do they want to take my billions?"

Yea.. Europeanize bitch. Also that sport where you almost never kick
the ball around is not "football".

---

I have a feeling some corners in US have a fear of being usurped
culturally by Europe. Pet conspiracy theory of mine is a secret clique
(!)  had girls play soccer (huge in Europe) so they could poo poo the
sport and say "yeah girls play that sport here duuude!

We need more action in US. I am talking EU Green New Deal level.

"At EU level, with the announcement of the EU Green Deal in December
2019, the framework of policies tackling the hydrogen industry is
profoundly changing. Thought as the EU‚Äôs ‚Äònew growth strategy‚Äô, the
Green Deal is a high-level political strategy which aims at carbon
neutrality in the EU by 2050. To achieve this objective to be
enshrined in the European Climate Law, the Green Deal encompasses all
sectors of the economy"

Governor Fredo.. This guy is actually dumber than his brother at
CNN. He thought he'd just snatch the nomination through some TV time?
How f-ing deluded are you?

"@StuDoesAmerica

Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs new book is out, a fictional tale in which he proclaims
himself master of coronavirus and viral savior of New York. But that‚Äôs
not even close to true"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
