Gross measures and other beliefs "trickle down" from academia to
journos who repeat what they get from "upstream". Left unchecked such
info can cause nonsense to become entrenched eg neophyte can conclude
"mo ppl no mo problems" perpetuating junk. Esp watch for Tom Friedman
like glib jagoffs, pop philosop journos who fashion themselves
"thinkers" but merely are adept at slapping catchy book titles on
stuff trickling down. Then, anyone who is able to question the base
assumptions of the measures in research, needs to do so. Quash this
shit at its source.

win for Russia. Doh!

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
