ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜† I said that didn't I? C'mon man, what's funnier than calling the
Pope himself a paisan..? I was joking... Of course he is Argentinian,
if we go by the culture code approach.

"This Pope is from Argentina, an Italian immigrant but by your culture
codes he is Argentinian. Why do you keep calling him a paisan?"

Daily Poster: "AsÂ high ratesÂ of police shootings and brutality in
California have prompted demands for police accountability, law
enforcement unions have dumped nearly $1 million into a state assembly
race to try to unseat a Bernie Sanders-backed progressive legislator
and longtime criminal justice reform leader, records show"

This battery business will get ugly, everyone best head for the
exits..  Based on typical 10KW energy consumption per person, a day of
storage and with 60kg of lithium / 70kWh battery means demand will be
90 times greater than world lithium reserves. This road simply cannot
work. Batteries are the business of 1 percenters, like this [cretin
fuck](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1607170043110/united-tesla-company-widespread-condemnation-of-elon-musks-bolivia-coup-comments).
Lithium is no problem for that guy, his father owned an emerald mine
in apartheid South Africa, so stealing national riches of a country is
in his blood. Others won't be able to stomach it, and trading one
rare, natural resource (oil) for another (litihum) will start looking
increasingly stupid as we dive deeper into the green revolution.

It's possible. There were some signs of it in *Endgame*. They will
only hurt themselves and their brand if they do that..

When directing becomes cuck, it basically stops being art. Then you
have no choice but create hierarchies. White women, black men, Asian,
white guy, it goes on.. If there is a fight scene, for example, who
beats who is decided by the hierarchy. Asian guy can be beaten by
black woman who can only be beaten by the white woman. Of course
everyone can beat the too weirdly foreign guy, that's like the lowest
point in the hierarchy.

It certainly was that way for Disney Star Wars cuckscripting, cuckdirecting

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
