People have the wrong idea abt how these people come about. The
expectation is President "Mountain Dew" Herbert Camacho shows up with
a machine gun, talks tough, all the time.

No. After WWI Germany was beaten down, economy in ruins, in a terrible
state. You can't be like Camacho. Fascist then first says **let me
help you brother**. Much later it's like let's kill some people over
there.

"There are a myriad of start-ups racing to turn trash into clean
hydrogen. CA-based Ways2H doesn‚Äôt believe we need landfills. With all
of the waste available throughout the world, they want to use waste as
the raw feedstock to produce hydrogen, which could power our homes,
planes, car and more"

ByteDance Caves To Trump, Agrees To Sell 100% Of TikTok To Microsoft"

Automatic silencing is suboptimal along with "autopilot defense" for
someone quitting, or losing their job. Dont silence Alex Jones,
Zerohedge. But that jerkoff bio guy at Google had it coming.

Not being a fit to where you work and feeling the heat is not being

This is all very simple you see. It truly takes an imbecile to make
this stuff harder than it is.

There are no foreigners in US past 0'th generation. 0 is the boat
obviously. 1st, 2nd, etc. are basically American. So you are not
Polak. You are not even dash something dash something. There is
nothing before the dash for you.

You don't even get the dash.

You don't deserve the dash.

You will never be a Republican Trump. At the first sign of trouble,
they'll do away with you. They want to whole spiel not this grab-bag
of hot-button stuff. They created those themselves to distinquish the
party from the fucking liberals!

.. saz the guy who ran on not cutting Medicare, Social Security, asks
companies "not to fire workers', and talks about ending wars.

Hiding his part leftism behind "money concerns" so it becomes more

Love that story with FB ppl at Davos with other media comps when they
heard about the formula used to rank them and they lost their shit and
FB lost theirs bcz they did. Boundless fail.

Here's the news headline I was looking for in my news feed: "Congress
panel concludes GAFA companies have monopoly power". *France 24* had a
*video* with this title, but noone had the text thing. Corporatized
news dissing news on monopoly perhaps? At the same time they don't
like Facebook, they could used this chance to flame them.

That was a great story.

Doesn't work. Neither side trusts you, and you end up being hated by
both. You could say Macron tried this in France, do some left, do some
right, but make one wrong move, ppl dont like your style, you end up
with protests ad-infinitum.

"Okay, so dont be lukewarm center, but why can't you mix and match
clear policies boths sides?"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
