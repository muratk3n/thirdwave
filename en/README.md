We can certainly fix the BEV problem -- by abandoning the shoddy tech.

"Hybrid electric vehicles [like FCEVs] contain approximately 85 pounds
[of copper].. battery electric vehicles (BEVs) contain 183 pounds"

---

Copper is used heavily in panels, turbines; not much we can do there (unless
we find pure chemical, photosynthesis-like process to generate H2 direct),
but we can fix the grid problem. 

---

Another reason to de-electrify and *not* use a grid for energy transportation

"[G]rid energy storage installations rely on between 3 tons and 4 tons [of copper] per MW"

---

Copper shortfall? Damn

"In an Australian first, renewable hydrogen will be delivered to 700
homes in Mitchell Park when Australiaâ€™s largest electrolyser is
switched on at Hydrogen Park South Australia (HyP SA) today. The
commissioning of the Australian Gas Networkâ€™s electrolyser at HyP SA
will see the 700 customers receive a blend of 5% renewable hydrogen
and natural gas delivered through the existing gas network"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
