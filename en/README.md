Dimensionless groupings that don‚Äôt depend on unit system invariably
have great physical significance. By examining the dimensions of the

NYT: "Last summer, oil and gas-industry groups were lobbying to
overturn federal rules on leaks of natural gas, a major contributor to
climate change. Their message: The companies had emissions under
control.

In private, the lobbyists were saying something very different.

At a discussion convened last year by the Independent Petroleum
Association of America, a group that represents energy companies,
participants worried that producers were intentionally flaring, or
burning off, far too much natural gas, threatening the industry‚Äôs
image, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The New
York Times.

'We‚Äôre just flaring a tremendous amount of gas,' said Ron Ness,
president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, at the June 2019
gathering, held in Colorado Springs. 'This pesky natural gas,' he
said. 'The value of it is very minimal,' particularly to companies
drilling mainly for oil.

A well can produce both oil and natural gas, but oil commands far
higher prices. Flaring it is an inexpensive way of getting rid of the
gas"

Why stress retracing the steps of innovators? Students need to see how
research is like. You are trying get something out of the jaws of
mother nature and she doesn't wanna give'm to you. They need to see
how hard that is, to reach point B from point A.

It's not just about "logic" (popularized by some scifi). Logic is
about finding inconsistencies within existing elements, mostly it is
not helpful creating new information.

Keyb via dedicated wireless receiver (plugs into USB) is
efficient. Stick something into the board and have it be recognized as
a particular hardware and have it just work. "But any BTooth receiver
can connect to any BT device dude..!". It's pain.

From a cost / benefit standpoint EU losing just England wld be less
painful for them than losing the entire UK. And for both Scots and
N. Ireland staying in EU is more beneficial for them... So the English
are the odd man out here.. everyone else benefits from letting *them*
go

"@ProfBrianCox

From a purely logical standpoint, shouldn‚Äôt this say ‚ÄòLeaving EU a
threat to integrity of the U.K.‚Äô because there was no threat before we
left? You can‚Äôt have a policy of erecting a customs and regulatory
border with your neighbour and then blame your neighbour for the
border.

"Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way
to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in
incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the
course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of
antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial
investments for what may bear little benefits"

Yeah - the Lebanese are tired of that shit. This is just marketing

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
