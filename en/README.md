"The first submersible application of fuel cells is the German Type 212
submarine. Each Type 212 contains nine PEM fuel cells, spread
throughout the ship, providing between 30 kW and 50 kW each of
electrical power. This allows the Type 212 to remain submerged
longer and makes them more difficult to detect. Fuel cell powered
submarines are also easier to design, manufacture, and maintain than
nuclear-powered submarines"

Need to learn from the founders. While designing the system they
always had the worst-case scenario in mind.

So it's all in the smell.. Where is the nonlinear regression (sorry,

N. Patrick Harris is in the new Matrix?

Is this thing going to be a dark parody of the first three movies?
Like a *Starship Troopers* but for computer simulation.

They might have tried to pander little bit, bad guy attacks "the
East", which is behind a wall, their leader looks Asian, but it's good
action movie, which means it talks to something human. You can't lay
it on too thick and expect it to be a good movie.

"*Mortal Engines* (2018) looks a bit like CH propaganda"

That amt of lithium can destabilize countries (Bolivia?). This tech
needs to be buried. Not fit for use anything other than quick
buffering of energy, in small amounts.

Even if battery makers removed **all** cobalt, the remaining issue is
lithium. Then we have 8-15 kg vs 0.007 kg of rare earth usage. This is
not even a contest. The closer I look at this, the worse the BEV
option looks

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
