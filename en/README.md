"Real fluids, even liquids like water, change their volume. In fact,
that’s just what sound waves are: perturbations in the volume (and
thus density and pressure) of the fluid. You may once have been taught
that the difference between liquids and gases was that gases change
their volume but liquids don’t, but that’s not really true: otherwise
you wouldn’t be able to hear underwater!"

"Although there is little consensus on the questions of when and how
the previous era ended—or what it means for the future—something of a
common understanding is beginning to emerge: The golden era of the
'90s was never golden to begin with. Like Gibbon’s Rome, it was
structurally and irretrievably defective, compromised by the arrogant
belief in its own myth of inevitable superiority. ...

Today’s problems are the *result* of that era’s mistakes. ... 

In 20 years, we have discovered that ..  the nation-state did not die;
that ideology and identity still matter to people; that the globalized
economy is out of kilter"

"@ericbradner

This roll call has been much more interesting than speeches and
shouting from a convention floor. Seems likely this will be the way
it's done moving forward"

Now the role goes to the "highest ranking foreigner" in Holywood; Russell Crowe.

*Superman*, another immigration story. And who played the father in
the 1978 movie? Bingo

---

Ed Norton is right too; *The Godfather* is an immigration
story. Remember the father didn't want "the life" for his son, saz to
the son near the end. That is the defining scene for the mov IMO

"The irony is that Capra, born dirt poor in Sicily and an Italian
immigrant with all the Italian mobster stereotypes that went with it,
best depicted the American dream of the greatest generation in his
movies. He showed that it was possible to become a full American and
not persist in an ethnic ghetto"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
