Here's a simple way that can happen..  Let's say u dont want to wait
for 1, 2, or 8 frickin hours to charge a battery. Then u say "we'll
just have a swap mechanism, u give your empty one, get a charged
one". Right there, you just doubled the amount of lithium needed bcz
on top of the lithium needed for cars, now u need just as much lithium
for bats that are waiting, offline to be picked up in case of a swap.

"But doubling the usage of lithium for transport does not seem likely,
we can make do with what we have"

One of those canisters could be charged in 10 minutes BTW. Most
e-bikes on the market I see require hours of recharging with meager
range.

Great H2 storage company [LAVO](https://lavo.com.au) whose tech turns
renewable fuel into a long-term storage mechanism.

[FRED graph](2019/05/stats.md#t3mff), 3-month treasury and FEDFUNDS
differential.

When the difference is out of whack, it can be a signal things are
about to go kaboom.

Since IR is a short term rate, it would be logical to assume the
instrument that is effected by IR the most can be a predictor of
it. This is the 3-month treasury bill, something the market constantly
votes on with their money. The paper below suggests 3-month treasury
price has some predictive value. 

"This paper shows that the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and
the federal funds rate has significant predictive power for the future
change in the federal funds rate during the volatile nonborrowed
reserves operating regime, but it has less and no predictive power
during the borrowed reserves regime and the federal funds targeting
regime, respectively. These findings suggest that Treasury bill rates
forecast future federal funds rates most accurately when the Federal
Reserve follows a well-defined rule that does not smooth the impact of
shocks on the federal funds rate"

But guess what, BJ agreed to it.

>NI will stay in the EU single market for goods and will continue to

FREEEEDOM!

"[N]o UK prime minster could ever agree to it," Theresa May had said
about an earlier text] which the commission have published, which
would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the
constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and reg
border down the Irish Sea.

*Supernatural* ended.. After 15 years! Great show... I bet it was
 inspired by *Constantine* when it first started.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
