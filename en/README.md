Didnt GOOG fight Australian gov for a similar request? I guess that
was broader in scope..

Make'm pay, who cares.. 3W tech cannot create its social structures
yet, tech is mostly effin shit up not building, well, at least
contribute something to the modern world (2W) in cold hard cash.

"Google¬†announced Wednesday it has launched its News Showcase product
in the U.K., meaning the tech giant will now pay for news content in
the country for the first time"

Starting with intra-routes makes perfect sense, due to potential
reduced range (the best any renewable can offer), but improvements can
be worked on while the rest of the system is established.

Yes, good term to know; if fossil is used to produce H2 but carbon is
captured, it is **blue** H2. If not, it is gray.

We all prefer **green** H2 of course.

Jack Brouwer of UCI sounds like a champ; he's been at the renewable
fuel concept for a long time. Wrote a white paper on pipe
transmission, SoCalGas noticed and they launched a pilot project based
on it, years ago.

Perusing through some Fukuyama found one error already: ".. [they reasoned]
development of human societies from simple tribal ones based on
slavery and subsistence agriculture".

Conflating slavery, tribes, and subsistence agro.. Wrong. Tribes can
occur pre (agro). Slavery can only happen during, and not while
hunter-gathering.

Fundam phy community tries too hard to live up to achievements of prev
generations, radio, elec, nuclear fission, etc, and see newer sciences
gaining on them (eg biosciences), and think they have to 'go sexy' to
remain relevant, plays on determinism, time, multip unvierses,
etc. But that's trying to jump ahead with shaky ground underneath
.. They dont even know what the Sun is made of.. how can they reason
about the origin of the universe?

In different setting Im sure Hawk wld have disowned black holes
decisively, earlier.. Sad the guy spent his whole life on junk
science.

I fault the env more, rewarding more and more curveball ideas, bcz
they create the illusion of momentum, progress.

There is much wisdom in population [models](2011/12/more-on-logistic-equation.md).
I talked abt widespread deaths ~10 yrs ago. Logistic eqn models deaths proportional
to ppl interactions (implying rush towards same resources) can kill..
A pandemic, similar, ppl interaction effects deaths.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
