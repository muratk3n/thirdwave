Wow. BTW tough to encounter such winds away from the oceans. Around
Medi it's mostly soft winds.. Gentle breeze. That's why ppl sit
around, eat gabagol, get fat and lazy.

"The strongest sustained winds body can probably withstand without
getting blown away is around 100 km/h"

"On Twitter, Tom Scharpling, an executive producer for Monk, lamented
that he had 'contributed to the larger acceptance that cops are
implicitly the good guys.' The former Law & Order: SVU showrunner Neal
Baer expressed regret [his detective character] 'was smacking people
around' while doing police work"

"Trump cannot postpone the election or the next presidential
inauguration; he has no means to do either of those things. Those
dates are set by law or in the text of the Constitution.Nor can Trump
somehow cling to power after Inauguration Day once the electoral vote
is certified against him. If the Electoral College certifies Joe Biden
the winner when its votes are counted in Washington, D.C., on January
6, then at noon on January 20, Donald Trump ceases to be president"

Representative democracy might have some staying power left in it
yet... The reason wld be ppl disliking eachother more than they
dislike politicians. I mean, c'mon, would anyone like to be governed,
even partially, by their next door neighbor who is likely a jagoff?
The one w the loud dog, or the one who doesnt like dogs.. take your
pick.

Everyone from Joe Biden, the Democrats’ presumptive presidential
nominee, to Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, is
ostensibly on board with hydrogen.

Biden’s recently expanded climate and energy plan supports using
renewable energy to make 'carbon-free hydrogen' at the same cost it
does from making it with natural gas.

"As the world seeks to rebuild from the coronavirus pandemic, support
is pouring in for hydrogen energy to cut carbon emissions ....

Of the $54 billion in economic stimulus funding approved in countries
around the world (but mostly Europe) that’s going toward clean energy,
19% of that is for hydrogen. ...

In just the past month…

The European Union, which is proposing an additional $500 billion or
more for green energy as part of its recovery, unveiled a sweeping
hydrogen strategy and targets for hydrogen made from renewable energy.

The U.S.-based conglomerate Air Products & Chemicals announced
plans to build in Saudi Arabia what it says will be the world’s
largest hydrogen plant powered by renewable energy.

The U.S. Energy Department announced 64 million worth dollars of
funding for hydrogen projects earlier this month and plans to invest
up to 100 million dollar over five years for two new research efforts
on hydrogen.

'In my view, hydrogen is today where solar was 10 years ago,' Birol
said. He expects costs to decline as governments grow policies
supporting it like they did with solar"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
