Politico: "A wave of pandemic-era speculation in Bitcoin and new shell
corporations known as SPACs is crashing, and Washington policymakers
are scrambling to come to the rescue of investors.

After a year of letting markets run wild, lawmakers are calling for a
crackdown amid concern that many small investors are about to be
burned"

Europe is hilarious to me, there's like a different country 35 minutes

"@FCHEA_News

@IEA recommends increasing global investment in hydrogen from 1B to
40B dollars annually by 2030"

I'm talking truly hard limits.. e.g. if everyone in an apartment complex
were charging their BEVs, at night, you end up [blowing a fuse](https://news.uci.edu/2021/01/27/uci-podcast-solving-climate-change-with-clean-hydrogen-fuel).
No electric line setup going into even complexes can handle that kind of current.. So a major 
BEVtard argument is quashed -- they cannot use existing infra, they need
brand new, expensive infra, for what is essentially an inferior solution.

There are hard limits on what electricity can deliver. 

"On a normal February day, Texans need about 54,000 megawatts of
electricity at peak demand. Early on that Monday morning [when
statewide failures happened] we needed over 70,000 megawatts as
heating our homes required more energy. When generators started going
down"

"@matthew_petti

It seems anti-Palestinianism is one of the most socially acceptable
kinds of racism in America.

I don’t know of any other ethnic conflict where educated Americans are
openly hostile towards an entire people…no one writes columns about
how Kosovars or Tigrayans have it coming"

Hamas advanced weaponry..(!) These are $500 rockets shot towards a
billion dollar defense system that can't hit a camel in the ass. The
casualties as of now are 20 to 1.

I never want to hear about Politifact. Ever. Never. Ever. I’m going to
use [these two screencaps](https://twitter.com/SohrabAhmari/status/1395159392287342592) if anyone ever cites that source"

The link suggests Einstein never dropped the variable speed of light
idea.

1920: *Die Ausbreitungsge-schwindigkeit des Lichtes mit dem Orte
variiert*

---

Constant speed of light. Black holes. The Big Bang. The Higgs
Boson. QED. All under attack.

"Note that the speed of sound in air varies, the speed of sound in
water varies, and the speed of seismic waves in rock varies. But it is
said that the speed of light in space does not vary"

Modified gravity apprently can supplant the dark matter hypothesis but
contradicts early universe theories? Well scientists have their early
universe theories wrong [anyway](https://youtu.be/NHOo3elX5-c?t=519),
so drop the necessity to co-exist with that failed shit, problem solved.

Mining itself is unnecessary, it's a technical kludge. See Nano.

The world needs green energy for actually productive things and there
is major shortfall of it, and this person is like "let's use green
energy for the most unproductive work ever, BTC mining"

---

Cathie "she gives me no" Wood [addressing Bitcoin's environmental
damage concerns due to excessive use of energy for its mining] those
issues can be addressed by using green energy". Beyond hilarious

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
