"The great seismic quiet period... Noise from trains, airplanes,
industrial processes, and other sources is recorded on seismometers
worldwide. Disentangling this noise is important for extracting out
natural signals [scientists] found a substantial decrease in noise
resulting from lockdown measures imposed in response to the
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"

cyber-warfare, threatened its neighbours and intensified the cult of

shareholders about China, global firms gloss over this brutal
reality..."

Built by a French-Egypt company.

We are talking big construction in Egypt so of course ppl had to die
as in during the time of Pheroahs.

"[The Suez Canal construction took] 10 years. Digging the canal began
on April 25, 1859.. Around one million Egyptians, mostly peasants,
were recruited to do the job under harsh conditions including poor
wages.. They had to remove about 74 million cubic metres of
earth... Around 120,000 of the labour died in the process due to food
shortages, lack of health care and ill-treatment"

Admittedly weird hangup but ever since I started doing my own #taxes
I've thought that brackets should be replaced by smooth
functions. Apparently actual economists have worked out the details
and it's kind of awesome"

"@maxberger

Bernie's conversation with @ezraklein is worth listening to in
full. Bernie's comments on Trump's twitter account drove all the
headlines, but his comments on Biden and the shifts in the Democratic
Party (and overall optimism) really comes through"

Using recorded lectures will keep ed quality high.

Record once, use everywhere. Govs can fund recording of such vids for
every subject, kids at school watch them over tablets. No more teachers
in the old sense of the word.

There will be "graders" not teachers in the new system. Grade is
pass/fail. Graders can hang around in study halls if they are not
grading (rare) both to keep it quite, and answer the occas questions
in their field.

I like this lecture format. You see the lecturer, and the equations
simply appear while he talks, parts gets highlighted for emphasis, and
necessary pieces get carried over to the next slide if
necessary. 3Blue1Brown style, which is all animation and lecturer
voice, is fine too but this one has more of a lecture feel to it.

*Rat Race*? Jon Lovitz driving around in Hitler's car giving speeches in fake
German accent to veterans (trailer).. Its already funny.

*Time to Kill*, good recommendation.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
