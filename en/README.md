"@OregonGovBrown

I think we‚Äôve had enough political grandstanding from DC. The
President‚Äôs plan to "dominate" the streets of American cities has
failed. And today, federal troops are preparing to leave downtown
Portland. We will protect free speech and the right to protest
peacefully"

Looks like control logic is the part that scares flight hobbiests ppl
the most; the hardware has a certain pull, connecting stuff, then
there comes control; which I especially like. I'll follow that math to
whereever the f it goes -- not kidding.

Then copy over ur public key to `.ssh` and u get passwordless
login, remote script ex.

First thing I do with Pi is enabling SSH and switch to "headless"
mode; no display. Remote connect from diff machine and type away... No

Noone sits around and defines these nice little categories for people
to fall into; politicians (therefore the people) naturally gravitate
towards certain blocks bcz of certain optimality. A hard-ass parent,
tough, strict with their children, would this person be more "work
till you die" type of person in his economics, or otherwise? The
categories arise naturally. If this natural division does not exist,
take that as sa sign of fail in the system.

Caring less abt the market is left, see [right acting left](2020/07/right-acting-left.md).
These are empty categorizations. Hollow.

"@arabbitorduck

Right-wing populism? I'll take it [he shared a graph which shows it
cares less abt the market]"

Example of [left acting right](2020/07/left-acting-right.md).
Corporatism is one of its main tenets. As long as you are wairing a
rainbow shirt, have a few black friends, and fighting sexism, racism
*especially* at a personal level where you are constantly naval gazing
for someone else's real or imagined past sins, it's okay to let
corporations buy America.

"@OregonGovBrown

After my discussions with VP Pence and others, the federal government
has agreed to withdraw federal officers from Portland. They have acted
as an occupying force & brought violence. Starting tomorrow, all
Customs and Border Protection & ICE officers will leave downtown
Portland"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
