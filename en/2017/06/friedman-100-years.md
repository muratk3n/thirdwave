Navies

Having achieved the unprecedented feat of dominating all of the
world's oceans, the United States obviously wanted to continue to hold
them. The simplest way to do this was to prevent other nations from
building navies, and this could be done by making certain that no one
was motivated to build navies—or had the resources to do so. One
strategy, “the carrot,” is to make sure that everyone has access to
the sea without needing to build a navy. The other strategy, “the
stick,” is to tie down potential enemies in land-based confrontations
so that they are forced to exhaust their military dollars on troops
and tanks, with little left over for navies.

The United States emerged from the Cold War with both an ongoing
interest and a fixed strategy. The ongoing interest was preventing any
Eurasian power from becoming sufficiently secure to divert resources
to navy building. Since there was no longer a single threat of
Eurasian hegemony, the United States focused on the emergence of
secondary, regional hegemons who might develop enough regional
security to allow them to begin probing out to sea. The United States
therefore worked to create a continually shifting series of alliances
designed to tie down any potential regional hegemon. ...

Cycles

[T]here is an odd—and not entirely explicable—pattern built into
American history. Every fifty years, roughly, the United States has
been confronted with a defining economic and social crisis. The
problem emerges in the decade before the crisis becomes apparent. A
pivotal presidential election is held that changes the country's
political landscape over the following decade or so. The crisis is
resolved, and the United States flourishes. Over the next generation,
the solution to the old problem generates a new one, which intensifies
until there is another crisis and the process repeats
itself. Sometimes the defining moment is not readily apparent until
later, and sometimes it can't be missed. But it is always there.[..]

In its history so far, the United States has had four such complete
cycles and is currently about halfway through its fifth. The cycles
usually begin with a defining presidency and end in a failed one. So
the Washington cycle ends with John Quincy Adams, Jackson ends with
Ulysses S. Grant, Hayes with Herbert Hoover, and FDR with Jimmy
Carter. Underneath the politics, the crises are defined by the
struggle between a declining dominant class linked to an established
economic model and the emergence of a new class and a new economic
model. Each faction represents a radically different way of viewing
the world and a different definition of what it means to be a good
citizen, and reflects the changing ways of making a living [..]

The founders consisted primarily of a single ethnic group— Englishmen
with a smattering of Scots [..] But they couldn't build the country by
themselves. Pioneers were needed to move the country outward and
settle the land west of the Alleghenies. These pioneers were men
completely unlike Jefferson or Washington. Typically they were poor,
uneducated immigrants, mostly Scots-Irish, who were searching for
small parcels of land to clear and farm. [..]

By the 1820s, a political battle was raging between these two groups,
as the ideals of the founders collided with the interests of the
settlers. The social tension turned into economic crisis and
culminated in the election of the champion of the new generation,
Andrew Jackson, in 1828. This followed the failed presidency of John
Quincy Adams, the last of the founding generation [..] Jackson's
predecessors had favored a stable currency to protect
investors. Jackson championed cheap money to protect debtors, the
people who voted for him. Where Washington, the gentleman farmer,
soldier, and statesman, was the emblematic hero of the first cycle,
Abraham Lincoln, born in a log cabin in Kentucky, was the emblematic
hero of the second.

By the end of this cycle, after the Civil War, the West was no longer
characterized by the hardscrabble subsistence farming of
first-generation pioneers. By 1876, farmers not only owned their land
but also were making money at farming. The landscape changed as well,
homesteads giving rise to small towns that had developed to serve the
increasingly prosperous farmers. Small-town banks took the farmers’
deposits and invested the money on Wall Street, which in turn invested
the money in railroads and industry.

But there was a problem. The cheap-money policies that had been
followed for fifty years might have helped the pioneers, but those
same policies were hurting their children, who had turned the farms of
the West into businesses. By the 1870s the crisis of cheap money had
become unbearable. Low interest rates were making it impossible to
invest the profits from the farms—and especially from the businesses
that were serving the farmers.

A strong, stable currency was essential if America was to grow. In
1876, Rutherford B. Hayes was elected president after the failed
presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. Hayes—or more precisely his secretary
of the treasury, John Sherman—championed money backed by gold, which
limited inflation, raised interest rates, and made investment more
attractive. Poorer farmers were hurt, but wealthier farmers and
ranchers and their small-town bankers were helped. This financial
policy fueled the rapid industrialization of the United States. For
fifty years it drove the American economy in an extraordinary
expansion, until it choked on its own success, just as in the two
earlier cycles [..]

In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt succeeded the failed presidency of Herbert
Hoover. Roosevelt proceeded to reverse the policies of the preceding
political generation by looking for ways to increase consumption
through transfers of wealth from investors to consumers. He championed
the industrial, urban workers at the expense of the declining small
towns and their values. [..] The Depression was overcome by increasing
demand, by creating jobs and social supports and then transferring
money to consumers. High tax rates were imposed on the wealthy,
relatively low interest rates were offered to facilitate home
ownership, and consumer credit was introduced for a range of
purchases. The policies kept the economy humming.

But by the 1970s, the formula was no longer working. High tax rates
made the risk of starting businesses prohibitive and favored large,
increasingly inefficient corporations. Marginal tax rates—the highest
rates paid— were in excess of 70 percent for the wealthy and for
corporations. By penalizing success, this tax policy discouraged
investment. Factories aged and became obsolete, even as consumption
remained high due to ready consumer credit. Without investment, the
industrial plant, and the economy as a whole, became increasingly less
efficient and less competitive globally.

In the late 1970s the baby boomers entered the period of family
formation, when demand for credit was the highest. All of these
factors, coupled with an energy crisis, brought the situation to a
head. Under President Jimmy Carter, the entire economy was
teetering. Long-term interest rates were in the mid-teens. Inflation
was over 10 percent, as was unemployment.

Carter's solution was tax cuts for the middle and lower classes, which
only increased consumption and put further pressure on the system. All
of the economic stimuli that had worked in the previous fifty years
had not only stopped working but were making the situation even worse.

In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. Reagan faced a crisis of
underinvestment and overconsumption. Reagan's solution was maintaining
consumption while simultaneously increasing the amount of investment
capital. He did so through “ supply-side economics”: reducing taxes in
order to stimulate investment. Reagan did not want to stifle demand,
making consumers unable to purchase products. His aim was for the
upper classes and corporations to be able to modernize the economy
through investment. This represented a radical restructuring of the
American economy during the 1980s, setting the stage for the boom of
the 1990s. [..]

Reagan thus completed the reorientation of the American economy away
from the principles of the New Deal, which favored urban working class
consumption over all other considerations, toward the suburban
professional and entrepreneurial classes. In this, he was seen by some
as betraying the heart of American society, the cities, and the soul
of American labor, unionized workers. Just as FDR, Hayes, and Jackson
were vilified, so was Reagan vilified as a betrayer of America's
common man. But Reagan had no more choice in the end than did
Roosevelt or Hayes or Jackson. Reality dictated this evolution.

<a name='china'/>

The vast majority of China's population lives within one thousand
miles of the coast, populating the eastern third of the country, with
the other two-thirds being quite underpopulated ...

The Europeans encountered a China in the mid-nineteenth century that
was going through one of its isolationist periods. It was united but
relatively poor. The Europeans forced their way in, engaging coastal
China in intense trade. This had two effects. The first was the
dramatic increase in wealth in the coastal areas that were engaged in
trade. The second was the massive increase in inequality between
China's coast and the poor interior regions. This disparity also led
to the weakening of the central government's control over the coastal
regions, and to increased instability and chaos. The coastal regions
preferred close ties to (and even domination by) the Europeans.
