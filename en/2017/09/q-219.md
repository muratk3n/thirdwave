# Q&A - 21/9

Did the Euro have a hand in Greece's demise?

Yes

Once in Euro, debtors figured now Greeks cannot devalue (pay back the debt in depreciated Euros, since they do not own the printing press now) and since their risk would still be considered "less safe" on paper, they'd have to offer better rates. Win-win in their minds. Naturally the Greek gov had huge influx of cash through its bonds that helped it pay for public services.

Question

Was Euro an export advantage for economically stronger countries, e.g. Netherlands, Germany?

Yes

A currency's strength reflects the confidence in that country, but after Euro, stronger countries were in the same pool with medium-strength countries, Euro's price reflected that, it became cheaper for Netherlands, Germany. Cheap currency = huge export advantage. Reverse was true for Greece, Euro become an export disadvantage for them.

Question

Then Greece should not have entered the Euro?

Not before they were ready

Huge influx of cash into government bonds covered up a lot of their weaknesses, such as an inability to collect taxes. Why try to collect taxes when money is raining down on you? But at the end of the day, bad governance is bad governance. It'd all blow up at some point.

Question

How do ppl make money from government bonds? The returns are meager.

Leverage

10-1 leverage turns 3% into 30%. Futures contracts, which can be based
on bonds,  have implicit leverage (but they are traded on open
exchanges -which Dodd-Frank prefers-, they are cleared daily, so they
are safe). Banks failed pre-2008 because they took huge leverage (not
on open exchanges) trying to make money in low rate environment,
creating excessive risk.

Yoshua Bengio (an AI expert)

"AI is a technology that naturally lends itself to a winner take all," Bengio said. "The country and company that dominates the technology will gain more power with time. More data and a larger customer base gives you an advantage that is hard to dislodge. Scientists want to go to the best places. The company with the best research labs will attract the best talent. It becomes a concentration of wealth and power."

Hmmm

Now this is something you can take little more seriously than all that Skynet bullshit.

But he is also wrong. To understand why, you need to have the view of an outside AI practitioner - not of the insider-academic, someone.. well like me. The techniques, the tools bleed out, no, gush out of these companies like nothing else you've ever seen. In fact they (especially Google) make sure they share the techniques because they want developer mindshare, they want ppl who will use their tools, ergo their cloud services, etc., they want to prove they are "da shit" in AI, so they can entice more researchers toward themselves. Awesome, for me. Can they get all great researchers? All developers? No.

That leaves the so-called "data advantage". Data can make a difference, better data = better models [geek] especially for non-linear models as all the good ones are [/geek] But there are too many hands involved to make anything good or neferious happen, plus these companies follow the law (much better than the government it turned out after the NSA revelations) ensuring things cannot go awry. People talk shit about Facebook, but we know for fact that their rules against any violation is draconian. You use FB databases to check out that ex-girlfriend, or do any other weirdo shit, your ass is grass. That same day.

So I see about zero signs,for any bad smells in tech today. There's bunch of bunk, it's probably "old media" trying to create an illlusion of SV because their scared senseless abt losing their media share.

Question

Did EU, its intelligence services engineer "a coup" to oust the previous President Yanukovych in Ukraine?

No

That was US + CIA (pretty sure WH did not have a clue). Why did they do it? What interest did US have in Ukraine? None. They did it simply to f--k with Putin's mind, then they watched him run around like a scared little bitch. Crimea was annexed, but, RU soldiers were already there.. They were inside the barracks, they just stepped outside the barracks. No major change. It was fun, I bet ppl at CIA had bunch of gas, but other events took place after that, civilians died, do the instigators care about that? No.

Plus US managed to insert a bigger wedge between RU / EU, good strategy for them bcz US does not want EU / RU raproachement.

Obviously RU state is a  sad sack of kleptocrats that needs to democratise, ASAP. That is a whole seperate issue.

Question

How much effect did Russia have on US elections through FB fake-news, hacking?

None

They surely tried, but their effect? Nada. Most of the hoopla is purported by media 1) to hit Trump 2) to hit new media. I do like seeing Trump cringe of course he would not give an inch "to our side" on climate, but it is what it is.

Systemic Risk Council

The Council believes that it is not possible to develop a single simple regulatory metric that would pass the test of time and withstand regulatory arbitrage. For that reason, it opposes exempting large and complex firms from other prudential regulations if they exceed a specified leverage ratio. [..]

The Council worries that the UST Report proposal excluding certain types of assets from total assets in the SLR would prove to be the thin end of a very thick wedge.

Interesting

They are not happy. Any comment around leverage rings alarm bells in my head. Post-2008 the understanding is banks are not there to make money. They are there not to f--k shit up.
