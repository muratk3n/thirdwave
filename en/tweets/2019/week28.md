Haha.. just saw SpaceX Falcon lander simulation package on Github, to

It talks abt one RL "Deep Shit" style controller. I wonder if SX used
that in their lander? I'd be very disappointed if they did.  Doc says
RL style did very well. Will you pay me money if I beat that approach
with straight LQR?

Just saw this by the metro line today, warning passengers about a
27500 Volt electric line! Suggesting not to approach more than 2
meters. I believe they are talking about the lines that go above the
trains to power them?

<img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muratk3n/thirdwave/master/en/tweets/2019/train1.png"/>

BTW this is an incredibly stupid design. You could safely and cleanly power the trains with hydrogen, no need for such crazy warnings and no need need for mile long cables.

In May 2019, Angstrom Advanced Inc officially completed the Microgrid
hydrogen-based power-storage system demonstration project. [..] This
groundbreaking project was the first of its kind on the East Coast of
the United States.[..]

The success of this project also proved the feasibility of
establishing and implementing “Hydrogen Energy Communities” or
“Hydrogen Cities”. In such a scenario, hydrogen would be the critical
medium in bringing together renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro,
etc.), power, heat and utilities, and the ability for grid
peak-shift. Additionally, hydrogen can be used as a backup power
source, as well as the fuel for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles
(FCVs). The ultimate goal of the “Hydrogen Energy Communities” is to
take advantage of hydrogen as a clean, zero emission energy source to
achieve sustainable development.

Yang is Just Do It Nike Man type. When in doubt, act should be your

themselves into inaction overthinking stuff.

I am starting to realize ppl make money through obfuscation. Why
explain when u can hide? Take the simplest thing a spin up an
obnoxious story around it? Imbeciles (goaded to be that way by ppl who
should know better) will eat it up. So called "religion", science,
journalism is replete with this.

In my writeups, in order to show end result I take snapshots from "the
system", and save them as simple images. "The system" could be my code
(for pendulum, double pendulum not too hard), or lunar lander, cart
pole from an outside simulator. In either case snapshots are taken,
saved, and I combine snapshots with ImageMagick for an animated gif
and share that as simple file.

So reader can see end result immediately, one click, see animation,
and more important, he sees how those snapshots are taken from the
system, shared as code in the writeup.

Setup requirements, nearly zero. Just one additional package install
on Python, if that.

Wiggers niggers dont get it. Less dependence, simplicity is better.

Docker tech can create a fully installed machine from a single
image. Instead of writing down a long list of "install this and this
first" some ppl like to just share a docker image.

But it is an overkill for this case. 

*2019-7-9 11:37:6*

---

I am emailing frickin MIT professor who taught such classes. He has
code but to make it work gazillion instl steps needed (readme actually
talks abt using a docker image!), and he turned the code into a
"framework" (which means scattering shit in multiple places so it
becomes extremely hard to follow). I bet he is thinking "Imma do a
startup one day, maybe, and this is how pro code looks like".

On an old vid of his I saw a boring-ass code on screen, i asked him
"where is that?". He is like yo that's gone man.

Bitch what have u done? Guy is failing with his first duty to the
public, to educate.

The state of sci education is obnoxiously bad. How much effort does it
take to do a write up on math, code that shows simple physical
systems. It turns out noone thought of it.

"But the invention of compass was so important!"

No it wasn't. You can find true north by just looking at the
sun. Remember the tilt of the Earth, so "at noon, it looms in the
middle of the horizon and directly south. That means when you're
facing the sun at noon, walking directly toward it will take you
south".

Calculus works well for physics because Calculus digs into the very
small (then puts it back together - derivation / integration) and the
real world also consists of the very small. So the mathematical method
mirrors the real world.

For AI what would that parallel be? What is the most basic building
block of thought?

"A match" maybe? Like ATPPTPPT is the same as ATPPTPPT, or a cat is
visually the same as another cat, within constraints. If something is
not the same, how similar is it? Can that be measured?

Maybe an algebra can be built around such basic building blocks. A
match, a pattern.

The man speaka some sense...

"Since these older and more economically powerful property owners
dominate the electorate, politicians are reduced to doing their best
Man of La Mancha impersonations: they “Dream the Impossible Dream”,
and aspire to bring about “affordable” expensive housing.

The best way to do that is to give young people a government handout
to let them climb onto the property ladder. A name evocative of
concern for the young, such as the “First Home Buyers Grant” in
Australia, or even more evocative, the “Help to Buy” Scheme in the UK,
helps make the policy look worthy.

This way, politicians are seen to be doing something to help the
young, deflecting blame onto others (as they rail against rigid
supply, which is not their responsibility), while actually fuelling
the engine that drives house prices higher faster than consumer prices
(and household incomes)[..]

That fuel is leverage – the rising level of household debt compared to
income. Not only can politicians do something about this by changing
the regulations on bank lending – they have done something about it in
the past, by changing the regulations in ways that allowed this bubble
to form in the first place.

House prices only took off when politicians followed the advice of
economists – and the special pleading of the finance sector – that the
economy would work so much better if the heavy hand of government
regulation was lifted, and industry was allowed to innovate. However,
the innovations we got were not industrial but financial, as banks
found ever more ways to persuade households (and also corporations) to
take on more debt.

Here the UK data is remarkable, even in the context of a worldwide
trend to higher levels of leverage. Between 1880 and 1980, private
debt in the UK fluctuated as a percentage of GDP, yet it never once
reached 75% of GDP. But in 1982, both household and corporate debt
took off.

In 1982, total private debt was equivalent to 61% of GDP, split
equally between households and corporations. 25 years later, as the
global financial crisis unfolded, private debt was three times larger
at 197% of GDP, again split 50:50 between households and corporations.

The key changes to legislation that occurred in 1982 is the UK let
banks muscle into the mortgage market that was previously dominated by
building societies. This was sold in terms of improving competition in
the mortgage market, to the benefit of house buyers – allegedly,
mortgage costs would fall.

But its most profound impact was something much more insidious: it
enabled the creation of credit money to fuel rising house prices,
setting off a feedback loop that only ended in 2008".

"This needs to be a people's revolution", etc. Bernie does say these
things but let's not forget this is coming from a leftist who's been
pushed outside the system for 40 years. He is worried "what will
happen to this movement if I wasn't around as a leader?". He is
worried the left being overrun by the right again.

But personally I don't think a repeat of post-Berlin Wall situation is
possible; There was a euphoria, the victory, an evil empire gone,
these things are unlikely to repeat near-to-mid future. The left is
here to stay.

I'd worry more about Dems being corrupted past the point of no-return,
failing to provide a home for left thereby creating a vacuum in the
political sphere.

"The [EU] Commission barely had time to celebrate reaching its
historic trade agreement with the South American bloc (comprising
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay) late Friday — after 20 years
of negotiations — when a storm of criticism blew in. Senior
politicians and agriculture lobbies said the deal is a risk to
Europe's sacrosanct farming sector and food safety standards, and
threatened to block its approval."
