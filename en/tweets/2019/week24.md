Whaddayaknow? Werner is right. Credit flowing to wrong places is more
dangerous than "surplus countries" and "deficit
countries". Varoufuckis take note.

From *Crashed* by Tooze:

"Germany’s savings appear as the counterpart to Spain’s trade
deficit. ​But accounting identity is not the same as causal
relationship. It wasn’t Germany’s excess savings, or its exports, that
produced the boom in Spain. It was the lopsided credit-fueled boom
that produced the demand imbalances, the trade flows and the savings
imbalances. Europe’s banking system provided elastic
intermediation. Had Germany’s domestic economy been in more robust
shape, Germany’s demand for imports would have been larger, and the
trade imbalances within the eurozone might have been smaller. A
somewhat larger fraction of the Spanish economy might have been
directed toward producing goods for export to Germany rather than
supplying the domestic boom. But there is no reason to think that a
smaller flow of net savings from a more rapidly growing Germany would
have done much to slow the credit-fueled upswing in Ireland or
Spain. In modern finance, credit is not a fixed sum constrained by the
“fundamentals” of the “real economy.” It is an elastic quantity, which
in an asset price boom can easily become self-expanding on a
transnational scale".

LA feels like a "village"; I hate the place already.

Village is an agrarian concept, closely knit gathering, which
basically means everyone's finger is up someone else's ass. Jesus, his
teaching, is left, against the "village" and Rome.

Gov (left) help to people will decrease connections, will make us more
human, that is a spread out populace with intermitten
connectivity. People who like to have sex with goat and sheep can
still do that of course, but I am thinking they will be in the
minority, as the culture is repugnant and revolting. Catholicism,
Ottoman Caliphate as cultures are all extensions of this which need to
be culturally cleansed.

Australians apparently still are somewhat nomadic and human.

@hexsteph

"Being in LA is like having to completely relearn basic social interaction. Australians are known for being laid back but I would say we are also quite reserved. I can't handle so many conversations with strangers. In the lift, in a queue, in a shop - people just keen to chat 24/7

Makes me feel like a cynical dickhead by comparison but also: I didn't sign up for a full-on interview every time I get into a lift & lost in thought when I'm never going to see that person again. I feel like I have to be mentally more agile to manage"

Making H2 production green will have immediate econ effects. We already produce hydrogen for ammonia, that is, for fertilizer production. 55% of hydrogen is for that. Make that green a humangous product becomes green. Than we use that green process for cars, heating, all sorts of energy.

Bernie speech on Economic Bill of Rights; very good. Bernie can seem like an outsider sometimes, but that really is not his fault. He seems like an outsider NOW bcz of the centrists plague. In the speech he basically said "I am Roosevelt" tying himself to the party through him. And it is right, during FDR days, he would seem like a regular Democrat. 

The Bill of Rights part is to reclaim the box of goodies which other candidates claim they'll dole out once in power. He turned the volume up, and took all the goodies back. And tied it into a coherent whole. The "are you truly free" part was awesome.

From Tooze book Crashed.

Now I know why I keep seeing this guy (Rajan) at honco meetings. He became India CB head later but it always seemed like he was treated as a prominent voice on econ issues. This must be why. 

"Every year in August the elite of the central banking and monetary economics world gathers at a resort in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In August 2005 the theme of the conference was not the crisis brewing in the US housing market but a celebration in honor of the outgoing Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. Most of the presentations were appropriately upbeat. But one rang an off note. It was given by Raghuram G. Rajan, an Indian by birth but a fully paid-up member of the American economics elite, professor at the Chicago Booth business school and chief economist at the IMF. His paper bore the heretical title “Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?”57 Rajan worried that the dramatic expansion of modern financial intermediation was building up a dangerous new appetite for risk. At Greenspan’s farewell party, the message was not welcome. Rajan was slapped down by Larry Summers. Wielding his full authority as former  Treasury secretary, Summers introduced himself as “someone who has learned a great deal about this subject from Alan Greenspan . . . and . . . who finds the basic, slightly Luddite premise of this paper to be largely misguided.”58 To highlight risks in a complex, modern financial system, as Rajan was tactlessly doing, was to invite “restriction” and other “misguided policy impulses.” It would be like giving up air travel for fear of crashes."

Sanders argues we need to rethink the meaning freedom: "Are you truly free when you spend half your income on housing? Are you truly free when you are 70 years old and lack a pension to retire?"

"Are you truly free if you are forced to work 60 or 80 hours a week because you can't find a job that pays a living wage? Are you truly free if you are a new mother forced to go back to work immediately after the birth of your child because you don't have paid family leave?"

Forbes 

"The growing use of lithium batteries to store energy has exposed one of the dirtier sides of transitioning to a low carbon economy. To create these batteries, there is a need for a range of rare earth metals that require heavy mining and manufacturing that emit significant emissions. Furthermore, major components such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt exist in a finite amount that is unlikely to meet the current and future demands for battery units"

"Long ago I was captivated by a seductively intuitive idea, one many of my wealthy friends still subscribe to: that both poverty and rising inequality are largely consequences of America’s failing education system. Fix that, I believed, and we could cure much of what ails America.


What I’ve realized, decades late, is that educationism is tragically misguided. American workers are struggling in large part because they are underpaid—and they are underpaid because 40 years of trickle-down policies have rigged the economy in favor of wealthy people like me"

IAC also needs to make others laugh. I am not exactly sure how this connects. Other profilers seem to think IAC needs to relate, of which listening is a part, humor is another, perhaps even stronger form of that.

Dubya, Clinton, DJT: All I Am CRM. This type is overrepresented among the media types, politicians. I guess not-listening in confused times can be / seem decisive, and if they listen, the game gets even better.

@teoliphant 

I like this part: "Furthermore, a derivation of a quantum theoretical description from logical inf principles does not prohibit the construction of cause-and-effect mechanisms that create the *impression* that these mechanisms produce data that can be described by quantum theory"

e.g. Pilot Wave Theory or Bohmian mechanics.

Also see 

"Electrons aren't actually waves" 

[Youtube](https://youtu.be/XV46ALr3OMg)

"There is a difference between saying 'an electron is a wave' and 'electron acts like a wave'". Physicist say the latter.

If we are to believe "certain countries" want to create a Eurasian super state that could rival the United States, they would _have_ to have a form of reliable energy, and that could be H2. 

Fossil can be controlled, and through it the world. But if fossil is gone, energy creation becomes distributed, that's a whole different game.

@chr1sa "Chinese kids are, contrary to grind stereotypes, awesome creative makers. UK kids are not. Wonder where US kids would land..."

Children are more of a blank slate than grown-ups. It is more likely the culture will beat that creativity out of them. That is the real problem.

Industrial left wants not as much the manufacturing jobs that disappeared but the political culture that went away with it. Asking ppl to unionize can help workers but also provides a body for the politician to interface with.

To which I say, the only union you will ever need in the 21st century is the Government of the United States of America. It can protect ur rights, get u more money, give u representation.

[Bernie](https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1134495274766950401)

"The 2008 Wall Street bailout was never meant to help ordinary
people. It only emboldened Wall Street’s greed, recklessness and
fraud. Bonuses went up, no one went to jail. That’s why I voted
against it. It’s time to break up the big banks once and for all"

Aah Sheila Beir. There is some good stuff abt her in Rickards' book.

"Distressingly, misogyny emerged again in 2008 when the most powerful
woman regulator, Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the FDIC, was sidelined by
a new boys’ club of Summers, Tim Geithner, and Ben Bernanke. Bair’s
dead-on advice to close insolvent banks was scientific. Instead the
boys’ club bailed out bank cronies at taxpayer expense. Born in 1998,
and Bair in 2008, both correctly analyzed response functions to
financial crises. Summers demolished them with bias and bad advice
both times"

I dont know abt misogyny, but Summers et al definitely sidelined her.

This is from Road to Ruin book. Rickards is a goldcuck, sorry,
goldbug, but he has the occasional good analysis and the expose.

Dem centrists make sure to "involve" progs mostly / only through the

think they will muddy the waters enough so the social justice issues
will be unheard. Another divide-and-rule method.

[After the most recent socmed bans] Latest bans are over the line. The
hammer needs to come down.

1st amendment should apply to Twitter, Facebook, etc. in a way that
cant be overriden by their terms of service. Regulation needs to make
sure that happens. TOS is basically an arbitrary set of rules put
forth by a corporation that you immediately click Yes on to get free
stuff

The client filters I talk abt can be used on centralized platforms
too. So Twitter filters nothing, bans noone. But any user would be
able to install a filter package that can filter out "unwanted"
content determined by that package.

There could be maintainers for those filters. I could install NoDem
filter with PG13 additions, maintained by.. Michael Steele? Eeey whats
up baby?.. Another package cod be UnCon filter by Rachel Maddow?

*2019-6-9, 18:46:53*

So platforms simply become conduits, no filtering on the server
side. Recommendations, ads.. that's another topic. But bans need to be
fixed 1st.

The latest bans are so blatantly stupid that it makes me think if
Dorsey and DJT cooked it up during that meeting to force some
changes. James Woods? U know DJT retweets him all the time. But then
FB is part of it. So odd..

Woods is just a regular asshole (it's true, so remember the characters
he plays in movies, he is exactly like that, but in real life), and on
the right. That's no crime.

Watching Yang on Rubin. Econ theory says when econ conditions change
(a business closes) retraining should occur, people switch to new
jobs. And during the industrial era you could switch from lifting
concrete to lifting sacks of metal. How can we ask people to switch
from truck driving to being a programmer today?
