"Robert Bosch, the largest supplier of parts and technology to the
auto industry, recently announced it's betting big on fuel cells,
planning for mass scale production of a new FC design that will make
sense in affordable cars by 2022.

Hyundai just bet almost 7 billion dollars on FC cars. It's aiming to
produce half a million of them, including the new Hyundai Nexo SUV, by
the year 2030.

Audi just struck a deal to partner on FC technology with Hyundai. The
company's chairman, Bram Schot, recently said that Audi is redoubling
its focus on fuel cell with a production car out in 2021. It's
apparently doing so as the R&D lead for the entire VW group.

Mercedes is developing the FC GLC F-Cell"

Bell's Inequality is violated, but that does not disprove realism, yes. Local realism might not be there, but "another type of realism" could be active behind the scenes. Particles can be connected through another structure apart from observable space (such as a graph structure), whose reflection is space (this is the ensemble approach).

That reminds me the R. Werner line, for the perfect econ imagined by
establishment economists to exists, all the following has to be true:

Perfect information. Complete markets. Perfect
competition. Instantaneous price adjustment. Zero transaction
costs. No time constraints. Profit maximisation of rational
agents. Nobody is influenced in any way by actions of the others.

But we know most of these are not true. Even if each item had 75%
chance of being true, all of them being true has a chance of 10% (all
probabilities multiplied). So this junk has 90% of chance of being
wrong. Who can bet on that? Can we bet the future, well-being of
humanity on these odds?

"[Economist] Lucas insisted that to be valid, a macroeconomic model
had to be derived from the microeconomic theory of the behaviour of
utility-maximizing consumers and profit-maximizing firms.

In fact, Lucas‚Äôs methodological precept‚Äîthat macro level phenomena can
and in fact must be derived from micro-level foundations‚Äîhad been
invalidated before he stated it. As long ago as 1953 (Gorman, 1953),
mathematical economists posed the question of whether what
microeconomic theory predicted about the behaviour of an isolated
consumer applied at the level of the market. They concluded,
reluctantly, that it did not:

>market demand functions need not satisfy in any way the classical
restrictions which characterize consumer demand functions‚Ä¶ The
importance of the above results is clear: strong restrictions are
needed in order to justify the hypothesis that a market demand
function has the characteristics of a consumer demand function. Only
in special cases can an economy be expected to act as an ‚Äòidealized
consumer‚Äô. The utility hypothesis tells us nothing about market demand
unless it is augmented by additional requirements.‚Äô ...

What they showed was that if you took two or more consumers with
different tastes and different income sources, consuming two or more
goods whose relative consumption levels changed as incomes rose
(because some goods are luxuries and others are necessities), then the
resulting market demand curves could have almost any shape at
all. They didn‚Äôt have to slope downwards, as economics textbooks
asserted they did."

debt if there is a build-up there, increase public spending as a

That can now be interpreted as doing public works while in crisis and
giving people money, as in social help (spending does not stimulate
the economy).

The comment is oft quoted, but most don't seem to know what followed
it; Keynes lived in an modern enough era with widely available media,
and he was good at stirring shit up. After that comment which would
surely trigger a response, they would ask him 'but why dig up holes,
why not build schools?'. And he would say 'well fine then, let's build
schools' &#128521;

This is patently false. The industrial production advantage does not
come from 'division of labor', it comes from plugging replaceable,
nearly worhless labor into an existing assembly process which is the
true advantage, the brain, the core of the production.

You can't take any ol' task, divide it up among people, and gain a
huge advantage. But a factory through a mechanized processes (into
which people contribute somewhat) create asymmetric results. The
assembly line *moves*, processes, ppl work on that line. 

BTW this division of labor non-sense comes from Adam Smith, who knew
nothing, essentially repeating what al-Ghazali said a thousand years
ago who was dumber still. An "economist" needs to ask himself, 'why am
I __still__ repeating this shit?'

certain angle, and a certain labor price, outsourcing to a (especially
dictatorial) country is easier. But if that's removed from the
equation, then automation will soldier on.

"[Story from 2016] Greg Hayes, the CEO of United Technologies, the
parent company of the heating and air-conditioner manufacturer
Carrier, just let slip a consequence of a deal struck to keep jobs in
Indiana [..].

Carrier said last month that it would keep more than 1,000 jobs across
two locations in Indiana, following pressure from President-elect
Donald Trump. The decision was touted as a win for the incoming
president, who had pledged keep the jobs from moving to Mexico.

The result of keeping the plant in Indiana open is a $16 million
investment to drive down the cost of production, so as to reduce the
cost gap with operating in Mexico.

What does that mean? Automation. What does that mean? Fewer jobs,
Hayes acknowledged".

Why control when you can simply replace? That's why this guy keeps
faceplanting, his core assumptions are rotten.

Even during industrial era the machines made ppl replaceable. People
unionized to offset that but that scheme ran into trouble with
automation, outsourcing. You can battle the latter but not the former
effectively (remember Carrier?).

labour power of human beings is the one unique commodity that
capitalism cannot control"

Judging the kinds of sci was being done post 70s, it looks like the TR
nat firebrand Oktay S. was involved in "normal science". He talks a
big game in his books but what he's done is basically appyling the
Standard Model (mostly Cop QM) to different areas, such as molecular
biology, chemistry, he did not push further in the frontier on what's
been started in 1910. A fine scientist though... The Teller story came
from him.

People outside of historically mafia lands cannot even comprehend the
tyrannical dingbatness of these places. Here is an example: when they
asked Mussolini how he defined fascism this is what he said: "fascism
is whatever's going through my mind at that point in time". Can u
*believe* that shite? This is beyond patriarchal, tautological
statement like parents use on their children, "why do I have to do
this?","because I tell you so". No this is not just that, there is a
spur-of-the-moment, flighty, sadistic side to it. Tyrants could be
tryannical at least based on some rules. Not this. It is *whatever*
going through my mind, *right there and then*.

A fossil older than Lucy was found; Anthropo Owen Lovejoy talks abt it here.

[Video](https://youtu.be/RzWNh9ZpOCw)

Paper

[Link](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/74)

Lovejoy saz we did not descend from chimps, we descended from
something already looking like human, chimps evolved from that too. We
became less violent. 

Darwin was wrong, not on the evolution process, but abt how he thought
that evolution took place (he had only a few fossils to work with). 

"She and her kin were slightly different from the other apes that
lived at the same time: there was something unusual about their hips
and legs that let them move in a novel way. These apes were beginning
their descent from the trees... Roughly 3.2 million years
later...[they] would dig up her fossilized bones [naming her Lucy]."

So basically constants in physics are akin to coefficients in
statistics or weights in machine learning. In stats these can reach
tens, hundreds, in Deep ML models millions. Weights are set by looking
at the data, more adjustable knobs give you more freedom, but then the
model starts losing its expressiveness. They are a fudge essentially;
A neural-net even after training, is an incomprehensible mess; it just
"works", that is feed a new data point, it can answer based on
previous points (which effect the formation of the weights), but
that's all.

"SU(5) is the most elegant way imaginable of unifying quarks with
leptons, and it leads to a codification of the properties of the
standard model in simple terms. Even after twenty-five years, I still
find it stunning that SU(5) doesn't work. Not that it's hard for us
theorists to get around the current failure. You can just add a few
more symmetries and particles to the theory, so that there are more
constants to adjust. With more constants to adjust, you can then
arrange for the decay of the proton to be as rare as you like. So you
can easily make the theory safe from experimental failure."

*2019-8-22 15:38:57*

---

"For all its usefulness, the standard model has a big problem: It has
a long list of adjustable constants. When we state the laws of the
theory, we must specify the values of these constants. As far as we
know, any values will do, because the theory is mathematically
consistent no matter which values we put in. These constants specify
the properties of the particles. Some tell us the masses of the quarks
and the leptons, while others tell us the strengths of the forces. We
have no idea why these numbers have the values they do,- we simply
determine them by experiments and then plug in the numbers. If you
think of the standard model as a calculator, then the constants will
be dials that can be set to whatever positions you like each time the
program is run.

There are about twenty such constants, and the fact that there are
that many freely specifiable constants in what is supposed to be a
fundamental theory is a tremendous embarrassment. Each one represents
some basic fact of which we are ignorant: namely, the physical reason
or mechanism responsible for setting the constant to its observed
value." --Smolin
