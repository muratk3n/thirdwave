Dont know much abt Stone, thought he was a Trump supporter, then heard him repeat the word "dementia" on interview abt Trump in psyop fashion as if he wanted an impeachment to happen (through dementia). Then I was like this m..t..fka is some shady bitch.

I think Liz II is suffering from experience overload. Like pff I've seen WWII what is this small potatoes nonsense (Brexit)? That was a mistake. Maybe she could've done more to prevent some of this damage early on.

Right right.. that was a thing... When Mad visited TR he went to a
resto and stuffed himself w food the pics made it to V and apparently
there was a small scandal around that.

Just saw a TR satire on it I remembered 

http://zaytung.com/haberdetay.asp?newsid=353741

It says Mad was "eating for all his hungry countrymen, mocking
imperialism in the process"

Yep. Stick to what u know.

"Reminder that @BernieSanders, who might well win the Dem nomination, once said these words in this order: "the American dream is more apt to be realized in Venezuela" than the United States. (h/t @ReaganBattalion). He was not alone."

He called the regime a dictatorship during 2016 and distanced himself from it actually.

Actually Brexit is syptom of something else; abt Britain's place in the world. A country who is culturally significant, creator of  a former empire, having kickstarted the current one, it is natural it thinks it can do whatever it wants.

When I wrote abt the US Pemmic. War, the actors were interesting; here Brits had to step in and merge two yankee companies who were at war. They were the grownups in this picture. Good or bad, for a while these people ran America. So it is hard 4 them to accept rules from others

Interesting; real estate tax thing could be a play 4 bboomer votes. Millenials are obviously a bigger group. The bill will die in the House for sure, maybe Reps hope to make some noise having supported it.. 

Meh. Is this the best you've got dude?

Despite the panic about fake news in the '16 election, most was seen by just 1% of readers, & spread by just 0.1%, mostly right-wing political junkies.

'"AI is the new electricity"

"AI = gradients + pray + love"

Etc.

Is there something in the water in silicon valley (and occasionally
elsewhere) which compels people to write what are, at best, empty ML
platitudes, and at worst (to paraphrase Pauli) "not even wrong"?'

After spending 6 months wandering through the healthcare supply chain, here is my “hot take”

Healthcare is fundamentally cheap. 

It just has really high prices.

Pick something: brain surgery, labs, doctors visit, medication, imaging. The unit costs are <25% of reimbursement

Another case 4 UBI; incomes can never increase past a certain amt; when they reach a threshold rising incomes contribute to company earning decline, then to an overall recession, at which pt employees are fired -> no income.
