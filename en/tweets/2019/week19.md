Interesting noone thought of using OpenAI Gym CartPole for diff eqn
based solution (ML ppl use it for NN based monkey solutions). The
problem is a very basic one in control theory. Chop chop man... a few
lines of Python would do wonders here.

---

They show cart-pole solution using NN / RL, wout bothering to go into
physics of it - the Lagrangian, optimization.. That's some monkey shit
right there.

Keynes' Bancor idea was supposed to fix balance of trade issues no? Could some1 look into this? 

Keynes was no goldcuck, so it was not tied to anything AFAIK.

Him and the Austrians, like Hayek did conflict a lot and I like some of Austrian ideas too. But all were agog with Keynes' brilliance. His math-fu was strong.

A great man, Keynes. I wonder what he'd do with today's tools and data.

How would UBI increase competition? Bcz corps would compete against worker not doing anything. Most wld prefer to do something but UBI raises the bar. 

At the same time it lowers it in terms of actual $$ they give. $5/hr now brings worker to minwage levels. Everybody wins.

Minwage req for Uber wont work, they are already losing money, and their stock tanked; UBI would help both them and their workers. We need to increase competition for workers.

They do say QM made certain calculations easier. I accept that, in a way imaginary numbers made some calculations easier. But we dont say imag numbers are our reality, whereas QM ppl make that claim. Why did Copen QM folks took their tools so seriously?

They could have said "here is some kooky shit, we enter and exit this domain as needed, once we get the result we forget abt the rest". They didnt say that, they went cookoo on dead cats alive cats, multiple universes shit like that.

Please do more of this; in fact I would make filming of every lecture in uni a prereq for getting any gov grant. Then we extend it to all subjects, then we fire all teachers. Teachers are modern day terrorists, forget school shootings, an average teacher is worse.

I have a feeling cheap money might be a way to nudge corps toward full employment (U2) but it only produces shit jobs. If u wanna take these effers down u might wanna hit on that. Shove ur leg in that shit. The head if that's not enough.

Corps are caught btw inno (full automation) and shit jobs; e-z money is enough to do the latter for now, which brings productivity down. Problem is feckless leadership, remove e-z money, let some companies crash, give UBI, move on.

The Internet is not yet abt "people power". What it did was widening the net (as in fish) that helped catch more of a rare fish (talent). So a tuber could be such rare fish. But his viewers arent necessarily demonstrating "people power".

You are now their leader and they will regurgitate what they heard from you. For the next topic, next crisis, they will still need leadership, direction from you.

We all want to take it e-z. I did my utmost best *not* to get into this energy biz, thought Musk had it all under control. He fucked it all up, so grudgingly some of us do what we do now.

All this money printing but no inflation, why? Another explanation, money went to the rich, who do not (cannot) spend it all on regular items. How many cars can a dozen billionaires buy? So excess money does not circulate, no inflation.

But of course noone wants their wealth to decrease, so it is invested which causes a bubble in the stock market. In Venezuella (a basket case ran by an imbecile) printed money is given to the people who circulate it in the econ which creates hyperinflation.

In the meantime we target full unemployment blocking inno, productivity goes down, creating shit jobs. Inequality gap widens. We need to increase inno, use UBI, fire everyone who are in shit jobs working for a "wage".

USD being the reserve curr is helpful too of course. Foreign countries constantly need dolllars which raises its value.
