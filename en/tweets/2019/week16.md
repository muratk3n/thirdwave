The only conclusive thing you can say about pop growth -> econ growth causal relation is that it is inconclusive. You can argue tech (econ) -> pop growth easier in many ways than the other direction. Noone can disagree indust revolution helped populations grow.

Impeachment proceedings would energize centrists a little more and help Biden to get nom, and he would lose the general in a big way. Or Bernie gets nom has more of a chance in gen (but still with disadvant). Either way I dont care. 1st opt centrists will get a major hit tho.

Is there enough to impeach: no. After Russia hoax this is another line that helps unify Dems and cuddle centrist losers.

If politics were not a concern, I'd replace socsec with UBI, completely, paying nothing extra. Society has no obligation to take better care of its elderly, it has a _higher_ resp to support its young, so they can learn, form families, open businesses easier.

Jordanson Peterson... hiding behind his laptop like a little bitch.. Watching the Zizek debate. It's glorious.

I don't want to be too unfair on Jordanson Peterson. It's a general attack laid on cons that they are idiots. It's sad they have to defend themselves on intellectual grounds so much bcz the other side keeps attacking them that way. Their angle was never intellectual.

The con stance, which comes naturally to a lot of ppl, with its family, country, etc. is almost the absence of intellectualism. Some parts of the left attack them from that direction tho bcz they are devoid of ideas themselves.

All Obama / Clinton money is going to Kamala... That's a huge demerit from me; but that means she is in play. The earlier pred I heard can still be valid - uncle Joe has too many skeletons, is hit, retires early, Kamala carries California, goes up against Bernie.

I still think Un wants to keep his existing pile (US can sell that) and only negotiate on further development. Hence his hints on restarting development recently. If he times escalation for 2020, it will be major pain in the ass for the WH.

I think Mr Mustache got slammed after the NK Vietnam debacle. He had the afterglow of a man who had a new asshole torn up right afterwards. 

Did they try too hard to push for denuke?

If funny money through speculative credit is given to speculators and they made bunch of money which gov taxed and spent, when after a crisis that money disappears (it was bubble money) and tax revenue decreases the cuts made to services is not austerity.

Teachers are a weird problem for the industrial left. They keep looking at them as "wage earners" which they are not. We expect quality from these ppl not pressing a knob over and over.

I wonder if I really bust my ass I can contribute something to molecular chemistry... So far my sci output is one thesis, number crunching / applied math for another thesis (economics), finding / reporting one error in a statistics text book. Basic research.. ? Hmmm

I hope this election will see the end of "we'll get business to give ...[insert social good]...to its employees" to provide for citizens. A particular kind of centrist cancer set in the Democratic Party which saw businesses at the center of all things.

So naturally Reps wanted to free biz, Dems wanted to burden them. But biz should not be the center of social help. Free college, M4A, nationalized transport, security operate outside them.

Without credit creation for asset purchases, and the thereby created asset price inflation, alternative asset managers like Blackstone or KKR would be out of business. Young people even in Germany are now struggling to enter the middle class. Try buying or even renting in Munich

Just remembered TR nat anthem has fascistic overtones (written in 1920s). It talks about a "heroic _race_". Which race? What kind of color is tigga color?
