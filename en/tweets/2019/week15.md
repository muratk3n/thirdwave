We’ve been lying about a shortage of scientists continuously since
Sputnik. We have too many scientists relative to our anemic level of
interest in paying for the basic research that created our modern
economy.

Why do we believe a >60YO lie? Because of who tells it.

Scientists.

Dalio: more education to fix poverty. Great solution, jackass. This guy cant even put five words together. He is in no position to be "generating ideas".

Yang's inexperience could be overlooked but his polsci "lay of the land" missteps cannot. He nearly did that circum. debate thing, that's a sign the campaign is ran by neophytes.

IDW intervened at the last second IMO and he got a respectable interview. Otherwise he was toast.

The idea for the original debate must have been planted "elsewhere", so Shapiro was probably bitchslapped from all directions.. That'd be hilarious to watch.

You see how these fuckers play the game though... U have to be alert. Very alert.

On related news; not psyched but not pissed Netanyahu won again; in an "only Nixon could go to China" way he might do some good. We'lll see. Killing, jailing Pals... all IS characters do that.

Saw an H2 catalyst paper, "Catalyst structure optimization for the oxygen reduction reaction on Pt and Au". 

There is a Github repo on it 
https://github dot com/VlachosGroup/ORR-Optimization

Code looked like network / graph computation? 

Intrigued.

Krug does that. He is also on the same page with Dick "Deficits Dont Matter" Cheney.

"While they're not on the same page regarding the alternative, Donald Trump, Paul Krugman, and the private insurance lobby are all mounting the same basic critique of M4A"

7 years. Damn it's a long time to spend at an embassy.. An imprisonment essentially.

Replying to @dweinberger

Sloppy and loaded language. "Ethics" too quickly devolves into "*my* ethics", which devolves into politics and parochialism. Likewise for "justice".  And "should" is just lecturing, which tends drive people away

"ethics" I particularly dislike. U can reverse-engineer it from long-term self-interest. No need for the touch-feely.
