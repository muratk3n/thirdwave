I. Morris says ppl actually willingly switched to agro; and there was
a certain ease abt the "security" of food retrival IMO, tho quality is
of course is questionable. I agree in the long term it was a lose-lose
situation.

"Jared Diamond‚Äôs 1999 essay about the transition to agriculture is
called, ominously, ‚ÄúThe Worst Mistake in the History of the Human
Race.‚Äù More recently, historian Yuval Noah Harari goes so far as to
call the agricultural revolution ‚Äúhistory‚Äôs biggest fraud.‚Äù In his
2015 bestseller, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, he writes,
‚ÄúThe Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food
at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate
into a better diet or more leisure.‚Äù Harari agrees that all that extra
food merely fueled ‚Äúpopulation explosions and pampered elites‚Äù and
that farmers typically worked longer and harder than foragers for an
inferior diet. Forced into settled communities as a last resort,
agriculturalists faced drastic increases in social inequality, much
more violence in the form of organized conflict, and self-appointed
elites who used monotheistic religion to lock in their power"

"Modern dentistry? We‚Äôll see that the cavities and gum diseases so
many of us suffer from didn‚Äôt arise until the advent of grain-based
diets of civilization and monoculture. Scientists analyzing remains
from modern-day Sudan found that less than 1 percent of the
hunter-gatherers living in the area suffered from tooth decay. Once
they adopted agriculture, the rate shot up to around 20 percent.

Most of the dangers civilization claims to protect us from are, in
fact, created or amplified by civilization itself. Pointing to
antibiotics and bypass surgery in this context amount to extolling the
virtues of seat belts and air bags without mentioning that our ancient
ancestors were in no danger of auto collisions. If you‚Äôve set my house
on fire, don‚Äôt expect me to be grateful when you show up later with a
bucket of water.

‚ÄãIf it‚Äôs making us unhealthy, unhappy, overworked, humiliated, and
frightened, what‚Äôs all this progress really worth? We know more or
less what it costs: nearly everything. We can tabulate the forests
destroyed, topsoil eroded, fisheries depleted, aquifers fouled, the
atmosphere pumped full of carbon, the cancers, the stress, the
desperate refugees, and more. People used to talk about leaving a
better world for their children. Now we just hope they‚Äôll somehow
survive the mess"

From the prestigious journal *Applied Energy* - says batteries will
never fall below $124/kwh making them useless for competing against
fossil. Making huge waves today.

"Learning only buys you so much: Practical limits on battery price reduction ... 

Conventional learning curves for manufacturing costs, used in many
battery projections, unrealistically predict battery prices will fall
below $100/kWh by 2030, pushing EVs to hit price parity with internal
combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in the absence of
incentives. However, in reality, essential materials jcosts set
practical lower bounds on battery prices.

Our 2-stage learning curve model projects the active material costs
and NMC-based Lithium-ion battery pack price with mineral and material
costs as the respective price floors. The improved model predicts
nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery prices will fall only to about
$124/kWh by 2030 ‚Äì much cheaper than today, but still too expensive to
truly compete with ICEVs, due primarily to the high prices of cobalt,
nickel, and lithium"

"[Morales] wrote a new constitution that gave him greater
powers... And he was unwilling to acknowledge the existence of a
legitimate opposition, perpetually vilifying his adversaries as
traitors.In recent years, as Morales‚Äôs support among the Bolivian
people began to slip, his attacks on democracy became more
blatant. [H]e [illegally] ran for a fourth term as president. And when
he seemed to fall short of the necessary majority to win election in
the first round, he engaged in what the Organization of American
States decried as a ‚Äúclear manipulation‚Äù of the vote. Among other
measures, he tampered with the electronic tally and halted the
count.His attempt to steal the election cost Morales the support of a
large number of Bolivians, including many trade unionists, indigenous
people, and longtime members of his own political party. As protesters
took to the street to demand his resignation, and police forces across
the country refused to use force to quash dissent, Morales was forced
into exile in Mexico"

Very important point. Wout "free stuff" (Linux) libertard goldcucks

So bug fixes, new features, for many projects were flying through the
Internet over this mechanism. Apache (>50% of web servers today),

A lot of open source in the early days worked through "patch
files". Say I have a file (it could be a piece of code), `originalfile`

```python
These are a few words.
One word is worth thousand pictures
```

And I made changes to the first line inside file `updatedfile` (this
an example, usually the change would be in the same file, but maybe in
a different directory)

```python
These still are just a few words.
One word is worth thousand pictures
```

Now I can use a tool called `diff` to find the differences, and put
those differences in a "patch file",

```python
! diff /tmp/originalfile /tmp/updatedfile > /tmp/patchfile.patch

! cat /tmp/patchfile.patch
```

This is the patch,

```text
2c2
< These are a few words.
---
> These still are just a few words.
```

Now I can copy and paste this into an email, to a forum, anyone can
take it, and "apply the patch" to their code base, fast forwarding
their `originalfile` to my changed version `updatedfile`,

```python
! patch /tmp/originalfile -i /tmp/patchfile.patch -o /tmp/updatedfile2
```

```text
patching file /tmp/updatedfile2 (read from /tmp/originalfile)
```

And recreate the version that I have, 

```python
! cat /tmp/updatedfile2
```

```text
These still are just a few words.
One word is worth thousand pictures
```

(skelatal gov provides along with health insurance), water and H2

Ancestor worship is an agrarian concept (see Ian Morris,
[WTWRFN](https://www.amazon.com/Why-West-Rules-Now-Patterns-ebook/dp/B003VTZSFY)). The
bad state of the so-called monotheist religions has to do with
co-optation of them by the agro-mafia-state. The Catholic Jesus is not
the same Jesus who preached to people.

"Before I started studying evolution, I was under the impression that
ancient Greece was a long time ago. It‚Äôs 'ancient' after all. But
ancient Greece was only about three thousand years ago. Rome, two
thousand. The very earliest signs of agriculture and fixed human
settlements appeared roughly ten thousand years ago. These are all
very recent developments"

"Here‚Äôs the story we‚Äôve all been told about who we are and where we
came from:

>We are descended from prehistoric ancestors whose lives were a
constant struggle against starvation, disease, predators, and each
other. Only the strongest, cleverest, most anxious, and most ruthless
survived to pass their genes into the future‚Äîand even these lucky ones
lived only to the age of thirty-five or so. Then, about ten thousand
years ago, some forgotten genius invented agriculture, and thus
delivered our species from animal desperation into civilized
abundance, leisure, sophistication, and plenitude. Despite occasional
setbacks, things have been getting better ever since.

In 1651, Thomas Hobbes described human life before the advent of the
state as ‚Äúsolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.‚Äù Three and a half
centuries later, it remains one of the most famous phrases in the
English language, and this Hobbesian vision of our precivilized past
persists as the central premise of the story of civilization. This
Narrative of Perpetual Progress (NPP) claims to explain the
superiority of civilization while taking it as a given. Inasmuch as
faith in ‚Äúprogress‚Äù is just another way of saying today is ipso facto
better than yesterday, the notion of progress is to be taken on faith,
and cannot be questioned without inviting the wrath of the true
believers. But the NPP poisons our minds, bodies, and relationships as
assuredly as it does the air, water, and soil. It justified millennia
of slavery and centuries of colonialism. ‚ÄãIt generates deep distrust of
ourselves and each other, shame and disgust toward our animal bodies,
and irrational fear and hostility toward the natural world we are told
is out to get us. It insists that we should be grateful for all this
progress we‚Äôve made because, by definition, the here and now is the
best time ever to be alive.

The clear implication is that any discontent or despair you may be
experiencing must be due to some fault of your own‚Äîcertainly not to
the civilization you were born into. You aren‚Äôt working hard enough,
consuming the right products, taking the right supplements, following
the right exercise regimen, driving the right car, or drinking enough
water"

"The widespread belief that noncivilized human life was and is a
desperate struggle for survival resonates with the haughty dismissal
of uncivilized 'savages' common to previous centuries. But beyond its
inaccuracy and racist undertones, this view has disastrous
consequences in the present. Life-and-death medical decisions are
misinformed by false assumptions about the capacities of the human
body, relationships fall short of unrealistic expectations, legal
systems based on inaccurate notions of human nature generate the very
suffering they‚Äôre meant to avert, educational institutions smother the
innate curiosity of students, and so on. Indeed, nearly every aspect
of our lives (and our deaths) is distorted by a misinformed sense of
what kind of animal *Homo sapiens* really is.  Dr. Jonas Salk, famous
for having invented the polio vaccine, put it memorably: 'It is
necessary now not only to know thyself, but also to know thy species
and to understand the wisdom of nature, and especially living nature,
if we are to understand and help man develop his own wisdom in a way
that will lead to life of such quality as to make living a desirable
and fulfilling experience.'"

Roman patriarchy.

"Cheap gas and an endless real estate boom were hallmarks of the
thirty years of postwar American dominance and prosperity; both ended
in 1973‚Äì1974. There were shortages of gasoline, electricity, and even
onions, and rumors of insufficient stockpiles of everything from
mustard to vegetable oil to cat food. In November of 1973, The Tonight
Show host Johnny Carson made a joke about a toilet paper shortage,
prompting a run on toilet paper as Americans rushed to buy every roll
they could find"

And these ppl somehow ended up being corp sluts.

"Though mainstream economists didn‚Äôt care about Hayek‚Äôs views, he and

Free Market Study. Both men were fiercely anticorporate, seeing
private corporate power as an equally dangerous form of central
planning" -- Stoller, *Goliath*

Stoller, *Goliath*

"Still, as exciting as the project might be in 1946, returning to a
pre‚ÄìNew Deal world seemed impossible. To reconstruct the system over
which Andrew Mellon reigned required an architecture with three
components.

The first component was the ability to rule an entire market through a
specific corporate monopoly, or shared control of a market through a
small set of corporations (which was known as an oligopoly rather than
a monopoly). Each monopolistic company would be a mini-government,
governing the prices, quality, labor, and supply chain of an
industrial product or service, such as aluminum, oil, steel, ships,
and magnesium. But during the New Deal, robust antitrust enforcement
kept concentration and monopolization at bay.

Each company had in turn been controlled by one of a small number of
oligarchs or banks, such as the House of Morgan, DuPont, Rockefeller,
or Mellon himself. This was done through the second component, the
connective power that turned each monopoly into a networked whole,
with mechanisms to discipline wayward corporate structures. This was
Wall Street, with tools such as holding companies, interlocking
directorates, stock watering, debt issuance, and various forms of
financial instruments. Wall Street, however, was deeply constrained by
financial rules.

The third piece was the rhetorical machinery, a set of intellectual
concepts and political institutions that would protect financial
empires from democratic influence. Money would be necessary, money to
develop and sell this ideology, not only to fund new academic
departments, but to buy politicians and lawyers, to influence voters
and newspapers, to set up institutions to persuade judges and
professors. Even more critical was rhetoric to explain the world in
ways that would organize citizens to seek not freedom from capital,
but freedom ‚Äãfor capital. But this was difficult to imagine, as New
Dealers seemed to rule the centers of cultural capital, the newspapers
and academic institutions.

It was their task to imagine it nonetheless. They saw themselves as up
against the world, and they were going to conquer it. The Free Market
Study, and then the Antitrust Project, would serve as the intellectual
testing ground for the set of ideas that would eventually burst out of
the academy and generate a political and financial revolution"
