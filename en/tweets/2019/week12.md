Thiel fashions himself a philosopher but he really isnt that smart. He regurgitates known points albeit from a different angle making sure he comes across "contrarian", as "the rebel".

But the alphabet is limited. If all u have is A,B,C u can rearrange these letters in so many different ways before u run out of options.  He dont got D,E,F, so PT is mostly running in circles. 

Then there is Musk.
