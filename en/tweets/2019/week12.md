"Anyone who has been to India should understand that at least within a
100 years India won't have an electric grid and charging
infrastructure that can support BEVs only. FCEVs are the only
realistic alternative."

Progs should not touch that with a ten foot pole. Two centrists need

So here's my thing re: Stacey Abrams as a Biden running mate. She's
immensely talented and I think very smart, and a good advocate. But
the highest office she's held is Minority Leader of the Georgia

wowwwww.....

"I  haven't seen any evidence that there is AI technology in the 737 MAX system. It is just ordinary control software. It does make a good scare story though. 

Decent AI software would avoid this error by comparing multiple sensors to estimate aircraft state before taking action"
