"I wrote the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which extended special
privileges to the region because of its unique status. This special
access to the U.S. and other nations helped drive the investment and
modernization that have enriched Hong Kong, and Beijing by
extension. Beijing must know the Senate will reconsider that special
relationship, among other steps, if Hong Kong’s autonomy is eroded"

"Up until now small variations in the current passing through a memristor device was not precise enough for numerical calculations. The Nanoelectronics group, University of Michigan, got around this problem by digitizing the current outputs—defining current ranges as specific bit values (i.e., 0 or 1). The team was also able to map large mathematical problems into smaller blocks within the array, improving the efficiency and flexibility of the system.

Computers with these new blocks, which the researchers call
“memory-processing units,” [..]. They are also well suited to tasks
that are based on matrix operations"

You bury the left, you end up with worse. 

"But the bottom line is this: Miliband came not to bury capitalism,
but to save it. He offered Britain a smidgen of basic social
democracy, the smallest taste of redistribution: curbing zero-hours
contracts and the vast power imbalance between bosses and workers; the
privatisation of natural monopolies and the rotting away of the public
realm. By dismissing that argument, the establishment in effect sent
out one unified message to voters mired in a slump: that post-crash
Britain was unreformed and unreformable. That argument was to be used
against the elites with deadly effect in the EU referendum of 2016."

There is this framing of the left that they cannot manage things; but
somehow cons f#$k shit up much badly and irreversibly than anyone in
the mainstream left.

"So much has changed this decade that it seems absurd to consider how
at its start, in 2010, a 40-year-old father of two and whiz on a
Rubik’s Cube was considered the biggest threat to the British
establishment. Did that really happen? Yes, confirm the archives. He
was Red Ed, a “Marxoid creep” (the Daily Mail, of course), the man
with the sneaky plan to turn the country into some socialist banana
republic.

How laughably tinny such jibes sound today. Seen in the rearview
mirror of a country hurtling towards a cliff-edge, undeterred by
Whitehall warnings of shortages in medicine, fuel and food, the
Miliband era looks enviable. You could quarrel and quibble with the
man, of course; you could pick holes all day long. But knowing what
was to come, how the next couple of episodes were to play out, would
you still have gone for the chillaxing blunderer [Cameron] who landed
us in a historic mess then grabbed the thick end of a million quid
from some poor sap of a publisher to stick his trotters up in a
£25,000 shed and yawn out a memoir?"

I dont completely blame them; the thinkspace is such a blithering
mess, it takes a regular person a lifetime to sort it out. Look at
science, instead of providing a half-sane theory for an odd
observation, they came up with an entire frickin multiverse.. 

This is science, how can other parts of analysis have any chance?

"But [Einstein's] revolution was not finished. The standard model of particle physics was certainly the triumph of this pragmatic style of
doing physics, but its triumph seems now to have also marked its limit. The standard model, and just possibly inflation, is about as far
as we could go with normal science. Since then, we have been mired, because what we need is a return to a revolutionary kind of science. Once again, we need a few seers. The problem is that there are now very few around, as a result of science having been done so long in a way that rarely recognized and barely tolerated them.
Between the early twentieth century and the last quarter century, science — and the academy in general — has become much more organized and professionalized. This means that the practice of 
normal science has been enshrined as the single model of good science. Even if everyone can see that a revolution is necessary, the most
powerful parts of our community have forgotten how to make one."

Whenever weird shit happens, I started to look more into whose
interests are protected. 

Japan: ultra low rates, weird. Whose interests are protected? Big
established companies who are neck deep in debt? CB saz low rates are
needed bcz of stagnant econ (which is a lie). The real issue is bad
banks, zombie companies lingering. They help them with low rates,
and/or creating bubbles in econ to push everyone in a certain
direction. But these comps only manage turnover debt with more debt,
contiuing their zombie state, holding back investment, inno. Econ does
not improve. CB says even lower rates are needed now. The cycle
continues.

Man up; clean out debt, bad credit, overtly. Enough with this bitchy
bullshit.

I guess I am closer to Fisherian explanation of the cycle, along with
Keen, Werner.

"The monetarist school of economic thought ties the economic cycle to
the credit cycle. Changes in interest rates can reduce or induce
economic activity by making borrowing to households, businesses and
the government more or less expensive. The Keynesian approach argues
that changes in aggregate demand, spurred by inherent instability and
volatility in investment demand, is responsible for generating
cycles. Adding to the complexity of interpreting business cycles,
other famed economists, such as Irving Fisher, argued that there no
such thing as equilibrium and therefore, cycles exist because the
economy naturally shifts across a range of disequilibrium as producers
constantly over- or under-invest and over- or under-produce as they
try to match ever-changing consumer demands"

I bet biz cycle with irate effect (as a control parameter) can be
modeled with second order differential eqn ay''+by'+c = u(t), the
solution to this eqn would be periodic - "the cycle". Then test irate
effects through its seperate coefficient, see how it fits to data
(tseries of gdp, irate).

You could jive off of the pendulum ODE too; there is a g there,
gravity, as in 'economic gravity', the control parameter irate would
be increasing or decreasing gravity (isn't that what ppl expect of
central bankers? Modify gravity?).

The result will most likely show no effect, which is Richard Werner's
claim. Macro effects irate, not the other way around (except for some
psych effects).

Kinetic energy is 1/2 m V\*\*2. To increase energy, the effect of the
hit, u either increase V (velocity, hitting "fast"), or increase m
(mass). Increasing m is much easier than increasing V. Just put your
body behind hit. Which means legs. Same for arm twists; rotating with
the whole body. Plus such approaches will work at an older age u might
get slow as f\*ck, but u'll still have body mass. Gonbatte godasai bitch.

That's the other crazy thing abt ST; u can have an obscene number of
them, all seperate versions. So what Feynman said abt ST in 80s still
applies today; the theory itself should tell u how many dimensions
there are, which version is the correct one. But it doesn't.

"At the beginning of the first superstring revolution, it was
miraculous that any string theory existed at all. That there were
eventually five was even more surprising. The sheer improbability
cemented our belief in the project. If at first it was unlikely to
work and then it did work—well, this was nothing less than
wonderful. Today string theorists are ready to accept the existence of
a landscape containing a vast number of theories, based on much less
evidence than we needed twenty years ago to convince ourselves that a
single theory existed.So one place to draw the line is simply to say,
'I need to be persuaded that these theories exist, using the same
standards that were required decades ago to evaluate the original
five.' If you insist on those standards, then you will not believe in
the vast number of new theories" --Smolin

"German theoretical physicist Olaf Dreyer, who argues that the
incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity can be
resolved only if we give up the idea that space is fundamental. He
proposes that space itself emerges from a more fundamental description
that is quite different. This point of view is also argued by several
theorists who did great work in the field of condensed-matter physics,
such as the Nobel laureate Robert Laughlin and the Russian physicist
Grigori Volovik" -- Smolin.

ha ha.. Apparently some fixes were made for this problem during 90s,
but then things became even hairier.

"String Theory initially proposed to unify all the particles and
forces in nature. But as it was studied in the decade following the
1984 revolution, something unexpected happened. The alleged unified
theory fractured into many different theories: the five consistent
superstring theories in ten-dimensional spacetime, plus millions of
variants in the cases where some dimensions were wrapped up. As time
went on, it became clear that string theory itself was in need of
unification" -- Smolin

A story on phycist Edward Teller: at the start of the semester, 1st
class, he is talking abt administrative details, points to his TA,
says "this is my TA John, his room number is .. what was it John..?
(TA says 120).. okay, you divide by 2, and add 5, mine is 65. 

You see, I can't remember but I can derive".

Story relayed by another physicist who was a grad student then, who
says he learned an important lesson that day, how deriving can
actually help you remember. Surely Teller was being somewhat
tongue-in-cheek about it, but this does reflect how good scientists
think. U need to be able to derive from first principles. It will help
you not only understand, also to remember, by deriving it if
necessary. Oh I forgot "integration by parts". Well.. did you know IBP
formula is just an expanded, rearranged form of d(f(t)g(t))/dt?

Fractional reserve theory is false. See
[here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070).
Article says "According to the financial intermediation theory of
banking, banks are merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial
institutions, collecting deposits that are then lent out. According to
the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere
financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively
they end up creating money through systemic interaction. A third
theory maintains that each individual bank has the power to create
money ‘out of nothing’ and does so when it extends credit (the credit
creation theory of banking)."

The right answer is the last one.

I re-did Keen's math in MathJax so math is viewable in HTML.

[Link](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2018/02/keen_nb.html)

BTW, if Keen wants his ideas to spread more stuff like this would be
helpful, with running Py code and math that shows all the steps of its
derivation. [Minsky
software](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minsky/) might not fit
everyone, it looks like a great tool tho. I was told Minsky generates
Matlab, not preferred in sci computation by many. Younger students are
more comfortable with Py tools.

Also I'd think abt moving Minksy to Github.
