"First impressions of Asus Chromebook Flip c434 as a Linux dev computer vs Macbook Air:

Pros: Cheaper ($500 vs $1000), can be used as Android touchscreen tablet, Ubuntu runs in parallel w/ Chrome OS

Cons: A bit slower, Android apps not as good as OSX apps"

I dont understand why American nats feel happy abt the prospects of EU
nats gaining power which can destabilize Europe. Do you really want to
deal with that aftermath? Small bitsy states all pulling in diff
direction, oh, and not able to hold back Russia?

Yang is coming apart; saw him on Igraham with a lost voice. I dont
think he appreciated the grind of retail politics before... It's not
about pretty ideas; it's about the leader (whose ideas must be
embodied in his person) who will lead to the promised land.

They came for his campaign with that bullshit debate. U had to see
that coming. U need huge endorsements.

Having held previous office is a must, media exp if not. People need
to see u deciding, leading on stuff. Odd but DJT on the Appr was
that. Most top cands have held office.
