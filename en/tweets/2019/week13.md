Reminder: algorithms can be biased on variables that are not a part of
the dataset.

Ex: Race is not an input variable to COMPAS recidivism algorithm, yet
the results are racially biased.

YouTube doesn't use extremism as a variable, but its results are
biased towards extremism.

"There is a strange class of Americans who seem to believe that anyone who isn't working 40 hours a week for a corporation ought to be euthanized (or at least made to suffer greatly). Is this really where we are at as a society?

Underlying this feeling is a great deal of racism also"

"Last ten days of China news on hydrogen fuel cells: Reduce BEV subsidy, keep #fuelcell; Snowman commits $600m; RONN Motor + CEDZ; Wuhan Grove car; Sinopec H2 stations; Foton bus orders. No mention by #energytwitter 'BEVs have won' crowd. Electric is motor folks. BEVs not end game"

That debt on the sheet is as good as fully monetized. Even $$ printed for biz credit is destroyed once it is paid back. Not this.

"Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Company Accounts show £103M profit over last 5

defense, public services, welfare etc."

"@Jacob_Rees_Mogg is now panicking that he won't wriggle out from
under the new EU anti tax avoidance laws after all...so suddenly says
he'll vote for Mays deal. The man is a true 'Selfservative'
carpetbagging charlatan, and that's saying it nicely!"

@markbspiegel

"Well, how about if we look at an auto company of  similar market cap that sells massively more cars and-- unlike $TSLA-- even happens to be profitable? Like, say, $GM.'

@WallStCynic

"Non-Employee Board Compensation: $60 million ($TSLA) vs $3 million ($GM)"

Interesting that one of those of companies manufactured <500k the other 500 MILLION cars. Guess which.

Yes new coal plants in Asia are a problem. In the West u can "get off
coal" easier, plants are old anyway, u just shut them off. In Asia
they r built and ppl expect an ROI from that. Wout carbon capture they
will pollute 4 a long time.

powerful national politician to support a consumer's right to repair
the things they own.
