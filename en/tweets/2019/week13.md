Reminder: algorithms can be biased on variables that are not a part of
the dataset.

Ex: Race is not an input variable to COMPAS recidivism algorithm, yet
the results are racially biased.

YouTube doesn't use extremism as a variable, but its results are
biased towards extremism.

"There is a strange class of Americans who seem to believe that anyone who isn't working 40 hours a week for a corporation ought to be euthanized (or at least made to suffer greatly). Is this really where we are at as a society?

Underlying this feeling is a great deal of racism also"

That debt on the sheet is as good as fully monetized. Even $$ printed for biz credit is destroyed once it is paid back. Not this.

"Well, how about if we look at an auto company of  similar market cap that sells massively more cars and-- unlike $TSLA-- even happens to be profitable? Like, say, $GM.'

@WallStCynic

"Non-Employee Board Compensation: $60 million ($TSLA) vs $3 million ($GM)"

Interesting that one of those of companies manufactured <500k the other 500 MILLION cars. Guess which.

Yes new coal plants in Asia are a problem. In the West u can "get off
coal" easier, plants are old anyway, u just shut them off. In Asia
they r built and ppl expect an ROI from that. Wout carbon capture they
will pollute 4 a long time.

Striking similarity between end of poll tax & end of Brexit. In weeks before Thatcher’s fall ever more absurd & convoluted attempts were made to keep it alive. But only viable course was to scrap it entirely & remove Thatcher

Revoke Article 50. Remove May. It’s that simple

I'd ban referandums triggered by politicians using a Constitutional amendment. 

Only people should be able to trigger a referandum, the way the recall election was triggered in California.

When pols trigger ref, they chose a time, the issue favorable to them. This is not democratic. 

Public op is fickle. Plus ppl are morons on policy anyway, the way I am about dentistry or beekeeping.
