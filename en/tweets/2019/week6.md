No superhero makes Europeans laugh more than Batman. There's something abt that character..  I guess too over the top. Iron Man is fine. Not Batman.

Disco S02E04 - not too shabby. Feels more Trek each ep. Fantastic #1

Less of that Klingon shite plz too and I think Disco is slowly phasing that stuff out. Hopefully we saw the last of that in E03, whatever that frckin storyline was, human/K dude joined Section 31, and it's done?

These scenes look like a Kiss concert  man, where all band members in need of a Heimlich maneuver. Garg garg... gaaarrrggg!

Gold has severe flaws. Physical locality makes it less secure and far more transactionally local, and thus more vulnerable to politics and less sound, than we can now achieve with Bitcoin, with good key management and taking advantage of its trust-minimized global settlement.

I love how Millennials are Ghosting Banks

Millennials are the largest generation in the US.

77 percent feel the traditional financial system is “designed to favor the rich and powerful.” 

75 percent worry about the global financial system being hacked.

Bitcoin has no fav's.

Wells Fargo, the 4th biggest bank in the United States has effectively been offline all day today.  No bank access at all.  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News all have zero articles about this on their home pages.

A common theme in science fiction is that in the future, mankind has learned from its wars and has a unified world government.

Alternative: mankind has learned that centralization is fragile and now has 10,000 sovereign but cooperative states, like Switzerland writ large.

NYT added major # of subscribers past year, making loads of $$$ there. I see TYT is pushing for it too.

For publishers it is a "surer" revenue stream. In the coming month u know your earnings. Pretty cool.

"I definitely believe this. @Tesla did not disclose the extreme range
reduction you get in cold weather. On most trips in my model 3 I get
50% less range than the car estimates. (This has been in 10-40F degree
weather)."

"Study shows electric cars lose 41% of range in ‘icy temperature’,
Tesla disputes the claim"
