Yea - there ain't enough cowshit to fuel such transport (assuming the
translation worked). H2@Scale has the right idea. Everything into H2,
and that into consumption.

"2) biofuel production will not scale to meet the demand ...flying

@markrittman

Three months into using a Pixelbook as my main consulting and dev laptop, doing @LookerData + @SnowflakeDB  dev in the cloud and running http://getdbt.com  from the built-in Linux CLI. One-third the cost of an Apple MBP, instant-on and a keyboard you can actually type on

But.. but.. I did some space stuff, doesn't the coolness from there rub off on the car stuff..?

No it doesn't, punk. You have to perform equally on both to be applauded equally.

Geostorm; watchable. I like the "marry her" scene.

Bezos really needs to get out of MSM biz. Sell WaPo. Get out.

@zuph

me at 19: why would someone with a cool stem degree want to sell kombucha at the farmers market or run a yarn store?

Man that H2@Scale news went off in my feed like a bomb. Kaboom!

I had seen a co press conference btw Perry and Birol (IEA) earlier. Perry was mega praising Birol, complimenting like mad. I was like WTH? ... WH must have told him so. This announcement makes sense now.
