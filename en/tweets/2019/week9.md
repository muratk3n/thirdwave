Cuomo saz he'll run if Biden doesnt?.. hmm

Bloomberg is out. Great.

Yea - there ain't enough cowshit to fuel such transport (assuming the
translation worked). H2@Scale has the right idea. Everything into H2,
and that into consumption.

"2) biofuel production will not scale to meet the demand ...flying
2-fold by 2030 "

This is may be as important as Yang's UBI policy

@markrittman

Three months into using a Pixelbook as my main consulting and dev laptop, doing @LookerData + @SnowflakeDB  dev in the cloud and running http://getdbt.com  from the built-in Linux CLI. One-third the cost of an Apple MBP, instant-on and a keyboard you can actually type on

---

But.. but.. I did some space stuff, doesn't the coolness from there rub off on the car stuff..?

No it doesn't, punk. You have to perform equally on both to be applauded equally. 

This guy..

me at 19: why would someone with a cool stem degree want to sell kombucha at the farmers market or run a yarn store?

Man that H2@Scale news went off in my feed like a bomb. Kaboom!

I had seen a co press conference btw Perry and Birol (IEA) earlier. Perry was mega praising Birol, complimenting like mad. I was like WTH? ... WH must have told him so. This announcement makes sense now.

You are in Hanoi. And I am annoyed.

Ahaha - just saw a Bill G. prediction saying that "spam will be solved
in two years" . Like.. over 10 yrs ago.

Spam is more than 90% of all mail now.. So maybe it's spammers sitting
around thinking "email will be solved in two years".

I wouldnt worry abt Don Jr's future in politics. I'd look closer at Kush. I think he'll end up staying in politics. Not as prez or other cand but in unelected posts. Secretary Kush. Trade rep Kush.

Britain "pondered the TR model". Why? Bcz it has free-trade deal but no freedom of mvmt in EU?

Maybe .. that'd work but Brexibitches might not like that either because then they would be "rule takers" right? "We want to shape the rules". Great. But that's called BEING IN EU.

The Paki thing could even be Iran related.

Relativity Wasn't Einstein's Miracle; It Was Waiting In Plain Sight For 71 Years

It wasn't the Michelson-Morley experiment, the Lorentz transformation, or the twin paradox that led Einstein's thoughts to relativity, but an 1834 experiment by Faraday.

I wanted to make this point b4.  What I dont like is fuckin MMT sausage-making-tied-to-$$-printing. As in any piece of legislation being able to print money into existence. That is a no-no.

But for a controlled, 1-shot legislation, whose infl effect will be limited, it can be ok

---

Haha... I was expecting to hear no growth in money supply so no inflation, but AY saz 1 trillion will be printed. 

NOW GET THIS: if printing is tied to one shot legislation it can be okay.

I'll have you know, in his own way, FED chief Powell is pushing for
M4A. At nearly every public speech he bashes "our unique way of
delivering healthcare". This is code for "current system sucks"; which
means a nod for M4A.

Cohen seemed to be on a book-tour instead of a testimony. "He wont
leave even if unelected", "liar, cheater", etc. Flammatory language,
legally unactionable, but targeting a particular segment of Bill Maher
panelists with their "cacerolada", empty anger but with some money.

I still think Pakis should never have been seperated from India. An
Indian state is independent enough while in the meantime fully
independent Pakis cant seem to govern themselves. Recently things had
improved but it's been long-running shitshow.

This is the film industry's highest 'honour' for an actor of Middle Eastern origin: cast them as a Bond villain."
