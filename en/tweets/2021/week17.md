NYT: "Last year, India and South Africa requested a waiver from World
Trade Organization rules governing intellectual property for
technology dealing with the pandemic. Dozens of mostly developing
countries have since joined them. A handful of rich nations, including
the United States, oppose the waiver, but thereâ€™s a widespread belief
that if America changes its position, other countries will follow"

"@doctorow

2.5b people in Earth's 130 poorest countries have not been
vaccinated... The humanitarian cost is unforgivable - and
self-defeating, as each infected person is a potential source of new
strains...

It was Gates who sabotaged the WHO Covid-19 Technology Access Pool
(C-TAP), replacing it with his failed ACT-Accelerator, a system of
patents and secrecy and vast profits for the pharma industry"

"Biolyse is a small pharmaceutical manufacturer in Canada with aÂ simple
proposition: provide a recipe for a coronavirus vaccine, and it will
produce 20m doses for nations in the global south. It has approached
AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, and even asked the Canadian
government to help it with compulsory licensing â€“ which would give it
the authorisation to produce another companyâ€™s patented product for
emergency use â€“ but so far no one has taken up its offer.

When I reached him by phone this week, John Fulton, the vice-president
of Biolyse, told me: 'Weâ€™ve been passed over. Weâ€™ve got this
production capacity and itâ€™s not being put to use'"

During WW2, the US government forced pharmaceutical companies to share
recipes for antibiotics. In the worldwide campaign against smallpox,

Jacobin: "For the Left, itâ€™s easy to hate the media, with its
entrenched centrist biases and loyalty to the status quo. But a world
without high-quality news is a world where meaningful democracy is
impossible. Thatâ€™s the message of media scholar Victor Pickard, who
argues for a transformation of our media system away from the model of
commercial news and toward a 'public option'"

Reuters: "A Japanese-Australian venture has begun producing hydrogen
from brown coal in a $387 million test project that aims to show
liquefied hydrogen can be produced and exported safely to Japan...

Japanâ€™s Kawasaki Heavy Industries is running the pilot project with
government financial support from both Japan and Australia in the
state of Victoria, home to a quarter of the worldâ€™s known brown coal
reserves.a

The project is producing hydrogen by reacting coal with oxygen and
steam under high heat and pressure in a process that also yields
carbon dioxide and other gases.

If the project goes commercial, the plan would be to bury the carbon
dioxide off the coast of Victoria, KHI has previously said"

NYT (Dec 2020): "To help Pfizer, the deal calls for the government to
invoke the Defense Production Act to give the company better access to
roughly nine specialized products it needs to make the vaccine. One
person familiar with the list said it included lipids, the oily
molecules in which the genetic material that is used in both the
Moderna and Pfizer vaccines is encased"

"United States first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and

Sci achieved much but there are still holes in the grand knowledge,
on some fundamental questions.

---

Frankly it was a bit surprising at first seeing sci folk still do not
know why planes fly. But then u think about misconceptions around
black holes, the big-bang, gasesous sun, then you are like 'yeah that
cld fall through the cracks no problem'

It is encouraging in some ways in that there is much to do.

The 90s-2010s period was spent on "barbarians at the gates"
narrative..  this narrative was excessive. Old Guard is still there,
carries some influence.. Notice "the Internet Guy" Bezos bought WaPo
joining the guard, rather than start his own thing doing "dhat
disrupting binness".

SSt cld provide a springboard to new outlets, those outlets need to
grow institutional muscle tho to compete

Slate: "Substack today has somewhere north of 500,000 paid
subscribers, which represents a meteoric growth rate but is still just
a fraction of, say, the New York Timesâ€™ 7.5 million... A key to
understanding Substackâ€™s impact on the news is to recognize that the
kind of journalism that tends to thrive thereâ€”so far, at least for the
most partâ€”is not actually news. Itâ€™s commentary and analysis, aimed at
the chattering classes"

Mostly, yes. Making diverse set of products is what contributes to
innovation, as Hidalgo [found](2017/08/production-gdp-globalization.md).
Whether from that angle, or from my greater-sum angle, the conclusion is the same.

"But then should everyone be able to produce everything?"
