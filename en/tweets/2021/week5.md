Fast digital payments are a good thing.. But a fiat currency needs the
ability to have its money base expand depending on political
decisions.

---

Hal Finney (so called "Satoshi")'s reasoning for creating BTC was
wrong. He created it in the aftermath of 2008 crisis (his pseudo is
taken after his neighbor's name who lost money during crisis), and
thought "printing money" was the culprit. The problem wasnt printing
money per se, but who it was printed for.

---

BTC is absolutely the expression of the naivete coming from common
tech guy - bright, shiny object loving, unaware of landscape, soc
ecosystem, side effects, etc..

---

Left-leaning econs dislike this thing to a man.

---

In the absence of clear-cut scientific law, differing views surface,
and among enough knowledgable people, their average leads to something
acceptably optimal.

In econ there is division around thriftyness and extra spending (some
research popping up on the question but nothing solid), right and left
have different answers. Fine.

But Bitcoin exclusively chooses one side of that argument, ignoring
the other (money base cannot expand = thrift) hence it takes itself
out of the discussion altogether. A country cannot adapt BTC as
currency bcz of this.

What kind of notation is that? If random, not-referenced-elsewhere
Greek letter is used, you have to assume summation over all indices?
$u_\beta$ means $u_x + u_y + u_z$? WTF? What the actual f--k man?

But they love proposing such ostentatious ideas, it makes them sound
smart. Hell one is thinking abt multiple universes.. isnt that smart?

Sadly nah.. I gurantee it a lot of these muckers are extremely
bleeping dumb.

---

Fundam phy is stuck, and they know it. But they mistakenly think more
elaborate ideas are needed to get out of it, enter endless "thought
experiments" on time, universes, determinism, etc. But it is very
possible what they missed is something basic, only two or three steps
ago. They built up all this shit thinking that step was real, so the
fix will involve fixing that error, or creating something more
fundamental than having these "sexy tricks".

Started to watch more cable news, this must be return to some kind of normal

"@MattZeitlin

wow wonder why VCs and tech execs want no taxes on capital gains, an
expanded market for equities, and short sellers banned and/or jailed"

Right it'd be pretty stupid if they kept dividing the stock market cap
by the same number, for three months.. Then there'd be no need for
this ratio, you would just look at the market cap value itself..

No they use projected GDP, and apparently take it from the
[GDPNow](https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx)
estimate of the FED.

"Wilshire uses market cap divided by GDP. But official GDP is released
quarterly? Do they they use that number for this calculation?"

---

Yep; bcz of incompressibility, star cannot collapse on itself, a
black hole cannot form. Years of pondering, books, articles written
assuming BH existence were all worthless. It all goes to the trash.

WH advisor Brian Deese, asked abt "what about Wall Street, volatility"
blah blah.. He was like "our focus right now is Main Street". Good
answer \#PBS

---

All-around shoot-the-shit is no picnic either, I tell you.

---

Skills to be a journo has to be different than the skills to be an
all-around shoot-the-shit commentator. Lots involved in checking a
story, talking to ppl involved in it, etc right? Lota focused skill

*Outside the Wire*, little *Training Day*'ish, but has some solid
anti-militant messages.. The actor with the wing-suit from *Avengers*
was in it. Brother was like the black Terminator!

Is this relevant today? Well modernity (the second wave, after the
agro first) added its own mental structures that are in some ways even
more encompassing, and intricate. No wonder many ppl are still
interested in these things.. Zen, Buddhism etc, not to mention other
mainstream religions from the West.

---

I guarantee it Eastern religions, Taoism, Buddhism are a protest
against agro, village societies as well..  These societies constructed
a conceptual world with its idols, worship rituals, rhytms so
ever-present that new religions would rebel against. I bet the Zen
koans are packaged to make zero sense in that frame, to stir shit up
in the mind so that only when that frame is dropped, it makes sense,
or rather, the act of trying to make sense is dropped, hence the
practitioner reaches "enlightment".
