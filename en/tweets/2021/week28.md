Polity was a great dataset.. it's been having funding problems?

"For the past twenty-five years, CSP/INSCR data resources, such as
Polity, have been generously supported with funding from the US
Government (through association with the Political Instability Task
Force); that financial support was terminated on 29 February 2020."

Up until 2020 BTI data confirms a [decline](2016/11/why-is-democracy-better.md#btiall)
(2000-2020). The fall is not excessive but it is there.

Polity results (same page) shows pre 2000 status.

The Independent: "2020 was 'another year of decline for liberal
democracy,' said a recent report from the V-Dem Institute, a
Sweden-based research center. 'The world is still more democratic than
it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but the global decline in liberal
democracy has been steep during the past 10 years.'"

Trying to reject a (null) hypothesis in stats is like demonstrating
guilt (or disproving innocence) in a court system.. To prove
something, one tries to disprove the opposite, at extremely high
levels "beyond reasonable doubt", then can be more or less sure that
the original statement is correct.

"New Theory of Flight.. The new theory of drag and lift of a wing is
fundamentally different from the textbook theory.. [The old]
Prandtl-Kutta-Zhukovsky theory which was developed shortly after
powered flight was shown to be possible by the Wright brothers in
1903, breaking the perceived mathematical impossibility of powered
flight based on Newton‚Äôs incorrect theory of lift from air hitting the
wing from below. We find that the textbook theory of flight attributed
to Prandtl-Kutta-Zhukovsky is incorrect, since it is based on
phenomena which are not carried by solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations"

These ppl cant seem to catch a break. 

Clinton restored that guy to power BTW in 1994 (backed up by UN Sec
Council decision -US mil deployed, dictators fleed wout fight-) but in
the long run did the intervention help?  H has much intervention,
there seems to be a repetition set in around that particular
dysfunction.

Increasingly, I dislike hearing 'Congratulations!' when someone says a
paper got into a fancy venue. It sounds nice! But to me, it
compliments the 'winning' (metadata) rather than the science
(content), and furthers the gamification of science"

Another pollution related scandal in Germany? Unbelievable. Of course
VW is involved.

"According to a story in Forbes this week, the fact that German
authorities have been looking into the auto industry‚Äôs business
dealing has caused industry leaders to engage in a mad-dash to be the
first whistleblower... Indeed, it looks like Daimler grabbed the
golden ring, which could save it billions, while Volkswagen, which
thought it had won the honors, came in second and BMW is a distant
third. Under European Union law, the first one to become a
whistleblower usually comes away with little more than a slap on the
wrist .. while number three pays the bulk, in this case, BMW"
