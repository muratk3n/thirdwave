Constants are key, and IMO physics should be taught through them,
i.e. how each is derived / measured, and each lecture builds towards
one, in succession. This connects with earlier idea of teaching
concepts as its founders discovered them.

---

And there are no black holes... (see interview with W. Kundt). Hawking
himself admitted before death 🤦‍♂️

Says particle physics community became "too big too fail" 🤣 

---

Right.. electronics uses QM but q tunneling needed for it was already
discovered 1928.

I knew things were bad, but only bad since 70s. This guy says it's
been bad since 30s.

Alex Unzicker: "I don't know how many of you believe that the Higgs
boson was the discovery of the century but what is sure that Einstein,
Dirac, or Schrodinger would have considered this discovery as
ridiculous they would never have believed that such a model with so
many unexplained parameters reflecting anything fundamental.

So I'm going to argue that particle physics as practice since 1930 is
a futile enterprise in its entirety. ...

First of all good physics is simple, and the true revolutions in
physics always simplify the laws of nature. Maxwell's electrodynamics
was a revolution because the electrodynamic constants and the speed of
light were condensed in one formula, eliminating one constant of
nature.  So did the Planck constant h simplify the laws of nature and
Newton's Theory of Gravitation condensed dozens of unexplained
parameters into one gravitational constant.

[Today's] particle physics is going the other way around. It produced
[too many free] parameters"

The vaccine rollout is so typical of this country's approach to
delivering public goods. A decentralized and underfunded patchwork of
organizations tasked with moving mountains by a federal government
motivated primarily by a fanatical fear of the wrong people receiving
benefit

The result: A system ripe for bad faith grift and line-cutting by the
wealthy and powerful that fails to deliver promised benefits at twice
the necessary expense, thereby undercutting public faith in the
program and leading to further decentralization and stigmatization.

It's far from an original insight, but I keep being struck by how much
more humane and effective our public programs would be if they were
motivated by a fear of people who need them *not* receiving services
rather than people who don't getting something by mistake"

*Red Planet*, 2000, must be Tesla monkey boy's formative film. It
shows Mars with atmosphere (not possible), talks of plans with ppl
living there (ur bones would fall off after long-term exposure), there
is even a killer AI (hyperbole). But if you were uninformed or
retarded you could believe it, and with media being what it is, get
all kinds of attention and money peddling this "vision".

I wonder how many people subserviently cheering Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook
and Google billionaires for destroying Parler a) have ever been on
Parler, b) know anything about it besides what CNN & NBC censors have
shown them, & c) compared the hate speech there to what's on FB &

Hitler's story begins here

"Currency War I began in 1921 in Weimar Germany when the Reichsbank,
Germany’s central bank, set about to destroy the value of the German
mark through massive money printing and hyperinflation... Capital
flight is a traditional response to currency collapse... Even the
German bourgeoisie was not immediately alarmed as losses in the value
of their currency were offset by stock market gains. The fact that
these gains were denominated in soon to be worthless marks had not yet
occurred to many. Finally, those who held unionized and government
jobs were initially hedged as well because the government simply
granted wage increases commensurate with inflation.

Of course, not everyone had a government or union job, stock
portfolio, hard assets or foreign operations to insulate them. Those
most devastated were middle-class pensioners who no longer qualified
for raises and savers who kept their funds in banks rather than
stocks. These Germans were completely financially ruined. Many were
forced to sell their furniture to raise a few marks to pay for food
and keep going. Pianos were particularly in demand and became a form
of currency on their own. Some elderly couples whose savings had been
destroyed would go into the kitchen, hold hands, place their heads in
the oven and turn on the gas in a poignant form of suicide"

Big Tech jumped the shark with that Parler ban

---

A lot of ppl are jumping the shark these days, all in their own
different ways..

---

Now interest rates are as low as ever yet there are still people
whining about the deficit. They just dont want gov to do
anything.. this is the real problem.

---

Haha.. "fucking bond traders", "being born again as the bond
market". Glib bullshit accompanied by technobabbling drama covering up
for lack of left-courage while trying to look TV-suave.. The strength
of this junk gave rise to *The West Wing*, taking place around
drama-infused boomers passing eachother papers while accomplishing
nothing.

"Clinton came face to face with the ideological power surrounding
deficit reduction at a January 7, 1993, meeting at the governor’s
mansion in Little Rock. There, Rubin, just selected to head Clinton’s
National Economic Council (NEC), and Panetta, the new chief of the
Office of Management and Budget, put forward the case for deficit
reduction, sidelining proposals for the large, innovative stimulus
that Clinton had advocated during the campaign. ... [S]tubbornly high
long-term interest rates had convinced Wall Streeters, including
Rubin, that a huge reservoir of investment money lay frozen and
untapped...

But cutting the budget meant eliminating much of the social investment
raison d’être promised during the campaign... An appalled Clinton,
confronted with reality according to Rubin, told his economic team,
“You mean to tell me that the success of the program and my
re-election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond
traders?” Carville would later remark that were he to be born again,
he wanted to be reincarnated as the most powerful thing in the world,
the bond market.

But it was Clinton himself who had appointed deficit hawks like Rubin
and Bentsen, the new secretary of the Treasury, who in turn chose the
orthodox Summers as a top assistant, later to succeed Bentsen as
secretary"

Obviously previous dereg didnt help either, it created a freer
environment where new tech entropy / disruption could reach faster.

AG is no cookie; he knew industry, banks... 'The loan officer at a
bank knows more about their credit risk than anyone FED could employ'
he'd say having worked at these places... And yet that risk assesment
somehow failed. How? It always bothered me AG kept saying he never saw
it coming. Now I have a feeling why, he knew the industry through the
prism of old tech; A calling B, writing shit down, people shouting on
the trading floor, B calling A back, etc.. and *some*
computerization. Nothing at the levels we see today.

---

This all sounds like a bizarre concoction of new tech and old; 2W
institutions, with 3W tech on top... You can't mix fast and slow this
way..

3W is not at a point it can build, right now it merely disrupts and
destroys. Like my earlier example of Newt in front of a chat app, the
app disrupts the singular Speaker, adds nothing.

Greenspan, on 2008: "Another important source of the failure of risk
management was the almost indecipherable complexity of the broad
spectrum of new financial products and markets that developed as
number-crunching and communication capabilities soared.

Investment managers subcontracted an inordinately large part of their
task to the “safe harbor” risk designations of the credit-rating
agencies ...

Most investment officers believed no further judgment was required of
them because they were effectively held harmless by the judgments of
these government-sanctioned rating organizations. Especially
problematic were the triple-A ratings bestowed by the credit-rating
agencies on many securities that in fact proved highly toxic. Despite
decades of experience, the analysts at the credit-rating agencies
proved no more adept at anticipating the onset of crisis than the
investment community at large, and their favorable ratings of many
securities offered a false sense of security to a great many
investors....

Even with the breakdown of our sophisticated risk management models
and the failures of the credit-rating agencies, the financial system
would likely have held together had the third bulwark against
crisis—our regulatory system—functioned effectively. But it, too,
failed for many of the same reasons that risk management and the
credit-rating agencies failed: an underappreciation of the risks faced
by the financial system and an increasing complexity that made
effective oversight especially difficult."
