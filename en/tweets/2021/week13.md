France 24: "Glimpse of a post-Covid future? Masks ditched as Gibraltar
nears total vaccination... Signs reminding people to wear a face mask
in public were taken down by workmen in Gibraltar on Sunday in the
latest indication that life is slowly returning to something close to
normal in the small British overseas territory. Gibraltar is one of
the first places in the world to have vaccinated virtually its entire
adult population against Covid-19 and may now offer a clue as to how
other nations will fare when their own populations are inoculated"

My approach allows for it..  We cant rule out schools tho, or "that
other place where kids can go to outside their home", or whatever it
may be called in the future, bcz it doubles as a daycare center for
many working parents (the pandemic made this clear), and especially in
poorer neighborhoods, if there is trouble at home, etc it can work as
a sanctuary of sorts, kids go there, to a well-known place where other
adults are present.

"But a lot of new ed approaches are around homeschooling, why aren't
you for homeschooling?"

I realized Seshat data file had some columns "scaled", so they dont
reflect the raw value. Where is the raw value? I find the original,
which has column values spread out to multiple *rows*. Woha. Scrubbing
now.

Walk before you can run. Glide before you.. motor fly?

"Orville and Wilbur Wright integrated and safely flew the first
successful, controlled, powered airplane. The process they used was
one of progressive design and was successful to a large degree because
of their experience with gliders. Previous attempts at powered flight
were unsuccessful because the inventors tried to fly first with power
before the subtleties of control were addressed. The Wrights instead
first learned how to fly using gliders as tools to solve the
challenges of actutator control, and then added power to invent the
airplane"

Russia definitely *wants* to be a critical force in Myanmar, and
elsewhere in ASEAN. Such a status would certainly be welcomed in the
region as a counterbalance against China and the U.S. But, as I wrote
last summer, it has trouble delivering"

"Flipping the classroom" decsription doesnt do justice.. I dont want
to flip the classroom around the same avg teacher, but flip it around
the bestest, for every subj (thr prerec lectures). 

---

We like seeing people toiling away, actively, busily 'doing
stuff'. Our current view of work is faulty. The grader position in my
ed system will admittedly not be too 'busy', simply sitting around in
the study halls, answering the occas question. But combined with
pre-recorded delivery of lectures to all kids, this system will create
better results compared to now where the teacher is "busily"
lecturing, "doing stuff" all the time.
