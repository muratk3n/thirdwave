mismanagement? More of the latter wld be my guess.

"Fuel repurposed from waste or organic sources"? You could say the
same for kerosene "repurposed from organic, dead dinaseurs". Or does

"Several startups are racing to get supersonic planes flying
again... United and Boom also want to make these flights
environmentally friendly, promising that these flights will be
'net-zero carbon from day one,' and rely completely on sustainable
aviation fuel, which is repurposed from waste or organic sources"

Peter Scholze: "I find it absolutely insane [in a good way] that
interactive proof assistants are now at the level that within a very
reasonable time span they can formally verify difficult original
research"

The downtrend on the real unemployment [continued](2019/05/stats.md#unempl).
The defunct unemployment number did its little fluctuation, threw ppl off,

Leonarda Di Caprio.
