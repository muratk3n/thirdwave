DW: "Opinion: China's New Silk Road is full of potholes. As the harsh
realities of China's growing power sink in, the county's appeal is
diminishing in the West. To keep it in check, more coordinated efforts
are needed and come September the tone from Germany may be decisive"

---

MB: "[T]he Filipino president, Rodrigo Duterte, has repeatedly
threatened to downgrade the U.S.-Filipino alliance, but he also has
authorized the United States to upgrade its military facilities in the
Philippines, ordered further reclamation on Philippine-held islands in
the Spratlys, instructed Filipino troops to 'fight to the death' to
defend these 95 ​islands against China, and threatened to raise the
Philippine flag himself on Thitu Island and to ride out to other
Chinese-claimed features on his jet ski and plant Philippine flags on
them too"

---

MB: "China’s neighbors have shown that they are willing to use
military force against China’s civilian vessels. Indonesia and
Malaysia, for example, announced in 2016 that they would sink foreign
vessels that fish or drill in their claimed waters in the South China
Sea, and Indonesia made good on this promise at least three times in
2016, firing on Chinese fishing vessels and blowing them up on
national TV—all while Chinese coast guard cutters watched from a
distance"

---

MB: "China .. cannot enforce its South China Sea claims. The sea is a
hotly contested zone, with five other countries laying claims to
portions of ​it. China has a more powerful military than these
Southeast Asian states, but they are closer than China to the areas of
the sea that they claim. In a war, Chinese forces would need to cycle
between the combat theater and a few bases hundreds of miles away in
southern China to refuel and reload, a commute that would severely
limit the amount of combat power China could sustain on the
battlefield. Southeast Asian forces, by contrast, could operate from
home bases bordering the combat theater and would have their full
arsenals at their disposal"

---

MB: "China’s neighbors have developed their own A2/AD capabilities,
which can deny China sea and air control throughout most of its near
seas—even without U.S. assistance"

---

MB: "[Due to amphibious difficulties] China, therefore, probably could
not conquer Taiwan, even in the absence of U.S. intervention. Even if
China’s prospects are better than I have suggested, the PLA clearly
would have its hands full just dealing with Taiwan’s defenders.
Consequently, the United States would only need to tip the scales of
the battle to foil a Chinese invasion, a mission that could be
accomplished in numerous ways without exposing U.S. surface ships or
nonstealth aircraft to China’s [antiaccess-areadenial -A2/AD-] forces.
Specifically, American defense planners estimate that it would take
ten thousand to twenty thousand pounds of ordnance to decimate a PLA
invasion force on the beaches of Taiwan. The U.S. military could
deliver that payload many times over with a single B-2 bomber or an
Ohio-class submarine firing cruise missiles from an underwater
location hundreds of miles away. Alternatively, the United States
could unleash its attack submarines on the PLA invasion fleet"

---

MB: "[In a conflict with Taiwan] China would try to sink merchant
ships supplying Taiwan, but rigorous research suggests that the PLA
could sink only 1 to 6 percent of Taiwan’s shipping, and these results
are based on assumptions that heavily favor China... China might hope
that sinking a few merchant ships would deter others from supplying
Taiwan. Historically, however, shipping companies and privateers have
operated in wartime; in fact, many have volunteered to enter dangerous
areas so that they could charge higher premiums. For example, the lure
of profits kept seaborne commerce going throughout both world wars and
the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War, wars in which shipping losses were several
times greater than what China could hope to inflict on Taiwan"

---

MB: "[R]ecent internal investigations found that the PLA 'is riddled
with corruption and professional decay, compromised by ties of
patronage, and asphyxiated by the ever-greater effort required to
impose political control.' According to U.S. intelligence assessments,
'the level of corruption in the PLA at least equals, and probably far
exceeds, the level of corruption in the civilian economy.'"

---

MB: "When Chinese firms imported foreign technology, they spent less
than 25 percent of the total cost on absorbing the technology, a share
far lower than the 200 to 300 percent spent by Korean and Japanese
firms when they were trying to catch up to the West in the 1970s. As a
result, many Chinese firms remain dependent on foreign technologies
and manual labor and have a rudimentary level of automation and
digitization"

---

MB: "According to a former Chinese biochemist turned whistle-blower,
'misconduct is so widespread among Chinese academics that they have
almost become used to it.' China now leads the world in retractions of
scientific studies due to fraud"

---

MB: "Since 2006, [CH] has tripled its spending on research and
development (R&D), employed more scientists and engineers than any
other country, and mounted the most extensive corporate espionage
campaign in history. So far, however, these measures have failed to
turn China into an innovation powerhouse"

---

MB: "[O]ne-third of China’s GDP and 90 percent of its high-technology
goods are produced by foreign firms that have merely set up factories
in China to snap together components produced elsewhere. This
practice, known as 'export processing,' accounts for 90 percent of
China’s high-technology exports and 100 percent of China’s trade
surplus. On average, of every dollar an American consumer spends on an
item labeled 'Made in China,' 55 cents go for components and services
produced in the United States. In other words, more than half of the
content of 'Made in China' is American"

---

MB: "Whereas the United States can feed itself with only 1 percent of
its workforce in agriculture, China devotes 30 percent of its
workforce to farming—and still depends on food imports to feed its
population... Economic development is, at its core, a process of
structural change from agriculture to industry"

---

MB: "American live in a less toxic environment. Air pollution is seven
times worse in China than in the United States and kills 1.6 million
Chinese citizens each year versus 200,000 Americans. Breathing
Beijing’s air is the equivalent of smoking forty cigarettes a day.

---

MB: "Many Chinese college students describe their schools as 'diploma
factories,' where student-teacher ratios are double the average in
U.S. universities, cheating is rampant, students spend a quarter of
their time studying 'Mao Zedong thought'"

---

*Unrivaled*, M. Beckley: "Entrepreneurs in China have reported

I am wary of these pricing, offseting schemes myself.. See vid
below. This is why quashing carbon at its source sounds
better. Renewable fuel comes out of producers, then the rest is
guaranteed to be green. No offseting, no pricing.. The infra of the
world becomes green from top to bottom.

MB: "During his first two terms, more than 1,800 of Putin’s decrees
were ignored or circumvented, and Putin himself estimates that only
about 20 percent of his decisions get implemented unless he intervenes
forcefully. The former president, Dmitri Medvedev, has stated:
'Without exaggeration, Russia is a country of legal nihilism. . . . No
other European country can boast of such a level of disregard for
law.' Rigorous studies corroborate this claim: nearly 30 percent of
Russians admit to breaking the law on a regular basis, and Russian
police earn more money from second jobs (roughly 40 percent of which
involves illegal activity) than from their offi cial salaries"

Aha turns out Rodrigues, of the Rodrigues formula fame was French.

---

MB: "France has banned fracking entirely, partly because its best
shale field lies directly under Paris"

---

Another (easier) way to fix the problem wld be to remove the problem
itself -- the teacher. 

---

MB: "[C]ross-national data suggest that the American system of teacher
recruitment, training, and accountability has been put together
backward: it draws teachers from the bottom half of college classes;
gives them minimal training; and when teachers fail to improve student
perfor- mance, the government imposes rigid standards, hoping to do on
the back end what it failed to create on the front end. By contrast,
countries with top PISA scores, such as Japan, Singapore, and Finland,
do the opposite: they select teachers from the top third of college
classes, train them rigorously, and then give them the freedom and
time to hone their skills and share best practices with other
teachers. As Harvard’s Jal Mehta has shown, such methods largely
obviate the need for external accountability, because 'selection and
preparation on the front end makes extensive monitoring on the back
end unnecessary.'"

---

MB has critism for US too when it is called for

Beckley: "Other worrying trends include the fact that the U.S. startup
rate (the share of new firms in the total number) has declined by 50
percent since 1978, and business deaths now outnumber business births
for the first time in generations. American corporate profits are at
all-time highs, but two thirds of U.S. economic sectors have become
more concentrated among a handful of mega firms, a fact that suggests
that rent seeking and price gouging, rather than innovation, caused
the rise in profits. For example, the four airlines that now control
80 percent of the U.S. commercial airline market (compared to 48
percent a decade ago) have profited immensely in recent years by
cramming more passengers onto planes without reducing ticket prices"

---

Beckley, *Unrivaled*: "The U.S. military ... can sink Chinese ships
and submarines virtually anywhere in East Asia. The main reason is
that the United States has dozens of missile-armed submarines that are
almost invulnerable to China’s notoriously weak antisubmarine
capabilities. In wartime, U.S. submarines, with the aid of America’s
vast undersea surveillance network in East Asia, could set up picket
lines near the combat theater, or near China’s ports, and sink China’s
ships and submarines with torpedoes, missiles, and mines.  According
to estimates by the RAND Corporation, in a PLA invasion of Taiwan,
eight U.S. submarines could destroy almost 40 percent of China’s
amphibious ships as they attempt to cross the Taiwan Strait while
losing perhaps one submarine. The same study estimates that in a
conflict in the South China Sea—where the sea is deeper and provides
U.S. submarines with better acoustics and more room to operate, and
where most of the PLA’s meager antisubmarine warfare forces cannot
reach—U.S. submarines could destroy Chinese ships at almost no risk of
being attacked themselves"

Yes and the solution wasnt a 'global approach'. Global pharma had to

The Guardian: "[NZ] prime minister has been coming under pressure from
allies to take a tougher approach towards country’s largest trading
partner. New Zealand’s differences with China are becoming “harder to
reconcile,” the prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said... Ardern’s
comments were made as New Zealand’s government comes under increasing
pressure, both internally and from international allies, to take a
firmer stance on concerns over human rights abuses of Uyghur people in
China’s Xinjiang province. Last week, the Act party presented a motion
for New Zealand’s parliament to debate whether the treatment of
Uyghurs in Xinjiang constitutes genocide"

Aand STL files can be sent to a 3D printer..Imagine during class
simulate an object, design it, at the end, print it 😶

---

Yes there are big hunking programs, like Chrono.. I'm talking about
something simpler. Reading STL files in Python is easy. Add some grav
effects, simple center of mass calc, force => movement etc.

Many dont realize how far modern scripting envs have come.. Talked to
someone the other day poor guy still toiling away in Matlab. Bro -
Wake up.

---

Another subj to be added to STEM curriculum, given an physical obj
description in an STL file (CAD progs create it), learn to simulate
effects to it in 3D space, w some code (use ready lib). Apply force,
see what happens.

Culture is not something that is "declared", and "assumed". It is
burned in the brain through the culture around you, through osmosis at
around age 7. First generation children of immig parents are getting
the culture of their lands burned in their brains, not their
parents'. So that weirdo fuck who came in with his bags, chicken coops
and shit who talks to you with an accent -your parents- are as foreign
to you as they are to their country. That is how people who arrive
into area / cultures become part of those areas / cultures.

---

'Feel connected to your land', I dont just mean 'a physical
coincidence', not 'he was there, and now I am there'.. I saw Golden
Gate bridge and you did too! So awesome maan.. No. I mean something
stronger. Think of the guy who lived on your land in the past, his
culture, if not his genes are *inside you*.
