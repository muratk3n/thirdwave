# Week 18

Aand STL files can be sent to a 3D printer..Imagine during class
simulate an object, design it, at the end, print it ðŸ˜¶

Yes there are big hunking programs, like Chrono.. I'm talking about
something simpler. Reading STL files in Python is easy. Add some grav
effects, simple center of mass calc, force => movement etc.

Many dont realize how far modern scripting envs have come.. Talked to
someone the other day poor guy still toiling away in Matlab. Bro -
Wake up.

---

Another subj to be added to STEM curriculum, given an physical obj
description in an STL file (CAD progs create it), learn to simulate
effects to it in 3D space, w some code (use ready lib). Apply force,
see what happens.

Ok.. that guy who played the French guy was the token French guy of
90s. He must have played that role like a bazillion times \#thecore

---

*The Core*, from an era of movies when stuff went wrong and you could
fix it by blowing shit up. Still good movie. Much rather watch this than
Disney Star Wars.

"EU says Appleâ€™s App Store breaks competition rules after Spotify
complaint.. Apple has 'abused its dominant position' in the
distribution of music streaming apps, the European Commission said"

"Warren Buffett faces showdown with ordinary savers over refusal to
act on climate crisis.. Buffettâ€™s company, Berkshire Hathaway, refuses
to publish information on his companyâ€™s climate impact and the risks
it faces as temperatures rise; now shareholders are taking a stand. By

Culture is not something that is "declared", and "assumed". It is
burned in the brain through the culture around you, through osmosis at
around age 7. First generation children of immig parents are getting
the culture of their lands burned in their brains, not their
parents'. So that weirdo fuck who came in with his bags, chicken coops
and shit who talks to you with an accent -your parents- are as foreign
to you as they are to their country. That is how people who arrive
into area / cultures become part of those areas / cultures.

---

'Feel connected to your land', I dont just mean 'a physical
coincidence', not 'he was there, and now I am there'.. I saw Golden
Gate bridge and you did too! So awesome maan.. No. I mean something
stronger. Think of the guy who lived on your land in the past, his
culture, if not his genes are *inside you*.
