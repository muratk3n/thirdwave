Power paste üëç

"@hazergroupltd

Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology
and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have developed a paste for
hydrogen storage. The institute is calling the mass 'power paste'"

Good.. At least be a Denmark. Democratize next.

"Cuba opens up its private sector in major economic reform.. Cuba
announced Saturday that private activity will be authorized in most
sectors, a major reform in the communist country where the state and

Quick doomsday check, if there r any spikes in earthquakes globally

No upward trend. Signal looks mean-reverting

```python
import pandas as pd
from quakefeeds import QuakeFeed
feed = QuakeFeed("4.5", "month")
m = [[feed[i]['properties']['time'], feed[i]['properties']['mag']] for i in range(len(feed))]
df = pd.DataFrame(m).sort_values(by=0)
mags = df[1].rolling(window=15).mean()
mags.plot()
plt.title('Monthly Earthquakes')
plt.savefig('quake-series.png')
```

"Missile purchase prepares [Oz Defence Force] for Taiwan
contingency.. This week the government announced that it will invest
$1 billion in outfitting the Navy with new missile capabilities to
‚Äòproject and maintain sea control‚Äô as tensions over Taiwan heat
up.. In a press release, Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said the
[Royal Oz Navy] will get 'leading-edge long-range anti-ship missiles,
extended range surface-to-air missiles, advanced light weight
torpedoes, and maritime land strike capabilities with ranges in excess
of 370 kilometres for anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, and 1,500
kilometres for maritime land strike missiles.'"

[Ph.D. is about depth](2011/10/phd-graduate-studies.md), not breadth.
The joke is "a PhD knows more and more about less and less until he
knows everything about nothing.". But then, there is something of
everything in that nothing :), so you'll have learned a lot, at the
very least develop brain muscles for that depth. It is also about
adding something new to world knowledge, not merely knowing more, its
not "undergrad times 10".

From [The Mathematical Reality Why Space and Time are an Illusion](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Reality-Space-Time-Illusion/dp/B0849ZXQB1):
"As early as the 1930s, the Dutch physicist and close friend of
Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, wondered why the wave functions for matter
(complex numbers) and light (vector fields) were mathematically so
different. The importance of this profound question is still
underestimated today. If one follows the mission to explain natural
phenomena in a unified picture, light and matter must be contained in
a single formalism. This means that there has to be a mathematical
object that on the one hand, must be a little more complicated than
vectors and complex numbers, but on the other hand must incorporate
their properties...

Hamilton..  one of the most brilliant mathematicians of all time
.. started to study complex numbers. If it was possible to define a
multiplication in two dimensions in such an amazing way, was it also
possible in three dimensions?... On 16 October 1843, while walking
along the Royal Canal in Dublin, Hamilton finally came up with the
answer. In three dimensions it was indeed impossible; but at that
moment, he realized that the tricky multiplication of complex numbers
could be transferred to a four-dimensional number system called
quaternions that had three imaginary units $i$, $j$, $k$ instead of
just one $i$. Whether Hamilton could already have imagined the
fascinating rotations that occur in this number system, we do not
know. In any case, overjoyed at his idea, he carved the constituting
equations into a stone of a nearby bridge

$$
i^2 = k^2 = j^2 = i \cdot j \cdot k = -1
$$

... If we come back to the philosophical question of what mathematical
structure could potentially describe all physical phenomena,
quaternions are a strikingly simple possibility. Since they contain
both complex numbers and conventional vectors as a subset,
quaternions, in principle, can represent all the number systems
physicists have used in their description of the elementary phenomena
light and matter"

No, encouraging useless work just so people are employed is a
no-go. That might equal pollution, ppl doing weird shit bcz they are
small entities, hard to regulate in the many.

Then maybe there'll be less [stubble burning](https://www.dw.com/en/india-pollution-how-a-farming-revolution-could-solve-stubble-burning/a-51166417)
and less smoke blanketing the capital city.

If fewer f-ing farmers implies less smoke, that option is a good option.

One rotation can supply two households for a day. W-O-W

"'Back of envelope' calculation shows on a windy day the #HaliadeX 13
MW #offshorewind turbine produces 24hrs x 13,000kW = 312,000 kWh. In
one day the rotor turns c.11,000 times, yielding 27.8 kWh per
rotation. Double the amount of energy that a typical UK household
requires daily"

They used to say about Oliver Stone that in his movies, it's like "he
is standing by your ear with a megaphone and yelling at you what to
think". If those crits saw these bizarre Trek shows they'd never
complain about Oliver Stone ever again. In comparison OS is the
motherbleeping grand bleeping master of subtelty.

---

The gentlest crit directed at such shows from our side has been "they
are not painting an optimistic future". I dont think that does justice
how badly these shows suck. The backdrop of *Firefly* was pretty drab
but everyone liked its characters, stories. No these weird shows lean
on an artificial message to insert agenda.

Yep, that's the guy, co-destroyed Trek

"The Silence of the Lambs becomes another bland procedural... *Clarice*'s
other co-creator is Alex Kurtzman, a practiced IP hack known for
Transformers, various Star Treks, a failed Mummy, and the worst
Spider-Man. That's a lot of money made off other people's
originality. Can't we institute some kind of limit on this stuff, like
maybe a person can only work in four pre-existing universes per
decade?"

Obviously ppl blame Renzi for crashing the coalition; but what did
this guy not get that he wanted? In repr democracies with coalitions,
small parties like his can be kingmakers. FDP played that role in
Germany for years.

You can still do journalism wout being physically at a place, all the

The deficit / thrift decision is a political one, so by definition it
cannot be de-politicized, taken out of the realm of discussions,
turned into some kind of TINA law. Parallels here to Bitcoin "not
printing money", depoliticizing that decision, disqualifying itself as
a national / global fiat currency.
