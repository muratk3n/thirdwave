# Week 27

Open Source Guru, Hintjens: "Iâ€™m writing this in late 2011. In March,
Microsoft paid Nokia about 1 billion dollars for a deal that gave
Microsoft access to Nokiaâ€™s patents. A little later, HTC bought S3 for
300 million dollars, to get access to S3â€™s patents, mainly because
Microsoft and Apple were attacking it. Then in July, a group of firms
(Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, RIM, Sony, EMC, Ericsson) paid 4.5 billion
dollars for a set of patents from Nortel. Google bid somewhat less,
and lost the auction. In October, Sony paid 1.45 billion dollars for
Ericssonâ€™s patent portfolio. Then in November, Google got Motorola
Mobility, and its patents, for 12.5 billion dollars.

Whatâ€™s staggering here is that in 2011, firms paid about 20 billion
dollars for patent rights. In 2010, Apple spent 1.8 billion dollars in
R&D. Google spent about 4 billion dollars. The total for the whole
software industry canâ€™t be much more than that 20 billion dollars...

The patent wars for one segment of technology are costing as much as
R&D into the future of all software technology combined"

which spurred the prisoners to work. Several convicts were even
awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour upon their release"

Did animation for the system too. It is incredible the amount of
open-source software infra available for this stuff.  All kinds of
shapes are in so-called STL files. Scripting languages can read,
manipulate them. Apply some rudimentary calc and science comes alive.
