I realized there are some gems about "policy vs crass pollster" angle
in George Stepahanapopopolloolololooloopopous book *All Too Human*.
See the fights against the rabid pollster Dick Morris.

Eff what ppl say, look at what they do with their vote.

They r idiots.. what else is new? (but representative democracy still works).

Glad I finally watched Tenet so I can leave it in 2020 with all the other bad stuff"

Critics are short-changing *Kong: Skull Island*. We can't expect to see
an exact remake of the original King Kong everytime. They got a fem
lead kinda looking like Jessica Lange but not exactly the same? WTH?

This movie is about war mongering. Better mov also IMO. The humans go
to an island accompanied by a military escort who is headed by a
colonel unhappy the Vietnam War ended (1973). He carries the war with
him to the island. Roles reversed now, the big ape is defending (kinda
like the Vietnamese were defending their home turf?), where the humans
are invading. And the enemy this time was something far worse.

It is subjectively important bcz ppl subjectively do "emotional accounting" at year level.. and since many ppl do it, tho subjective it may be, it makes the turn of the year objectively important.

But I appreciate the subversion of expectations, the quicky-contra ðŸ˜‰

"The year is just a number its not important"

Then if Senate leadership is not codified in law, I guess party
discipline is playing a role in keeping everyone in line? People
follow the precedent (and the leader) bcz they dont want to incur the
party's wrath. But the leader also has to watch his coalition, he
couldn't just willy nilly do stuff, bring anything for a vote.. He
himself is also elected by his party members.

"Under the rules, all senators are essentially equal. That is, no
senator is more powerful than another. However, the majority leader is
clearly considered to be the most powerful senator today. This
perception is based on his ability to make motions to proceed to
legislation and nominations and to fill the so-called amendment tree
(i.e. offer the maximum allowable number of amendments to legislation
to block senators from offering their own amendments). Both are based
on his ability to be recognized first by the Senateâ€™s Presiding
Officer. But the leaderâ€™s preferential recognition and, by extension,
his ability to make motions to proceed to bills and nominees and his
ability to fill the amendment tree, are grounded only in
precedent. And the leaderâ€™s power in these areas is perpetuated simply
by senatorsâ€™ continued deference to the majority leader to wield them
however he chooses"

Trade if you must, buy if you need, but nothing beats highly localized
networks which have dense interlocking know-how. This is why advanced
countries are advanced. Pfizer/BioNTech develops drug with
cooperation, but they are at the center of that cooperation and their
chief scis are based in Germany. The cooperation part is secondary,
and moot.

Of course they are. Both are major exporters.

"China and Germany are pro-globalization"

He is powerful bcz other Senators defer to him. This power doesnt seem to be based on anything legally binding.

"McConnell is powerful. He blocks everything"
