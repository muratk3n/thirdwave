# Week 24

IMO it's a mistake to optimize for full-employment.

It's true.. the unemployment rate is plateuing and looks like at a level
higher than pre pandemic.

"A large slice of workers laid off during the Covid pandemic are
reporting that their jobs arenâ€™t coming back"

Zionism also carries the residue of the 30s. They were crushed by that
nationalism, but in a bizarre reversal, they assumed it (the tortured
imitating the torturer), and under the protective shield of their
victimization nursed it to this day.

See [people without a land, and a land without people](2020/06/10-myths-israel.md#land)

Similar bullshit: "we arrived in the our lands, and there was noone
there".

---

Ethnic nationalism was en vogue then.. Some thought Germans "descended
from Proto-Aryans, who [..]  dwelt on the North German Plain and may
ultimately have originated on the lost continent of Atlantis". That
*herrenvolk* business.. FROM ATLANTIS. Some dumb-ass shit right? Kinda
similar to bunch of punks from Central Asia rolling into Anatolia,
*finding it empty*, bringing civilization there, right? *tiggervolk*

"[S]ince 1999, when Hugo Chavez ushered in a socialist revolution,
Venezuela allowed the [Colombian] rebels to use its territory in their
fight against the Colombian government, which is a U.S. ally. Under
Colombia's 2016 peace agreement, most of the rebels disarmed, but some
refused. And many of these guerrillas are thought to be smuggling
Colombian cocaine through Venezuela in cahoots with the Venezuelan
army. McDermott claims the fighting broke out when one guerrilla
faction tried to bypass the Venezuelan military and keep most or all
of the cocaine profits"

"@ianbremmer

Trump was personally more aligned towards Putin than any recent US
President (and look at the difference in TIME covers [[one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3muJuUXEAE983-?format=jpg&name=small),[two](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3muJuSWYAg377F?format=jpg&name=small)].
But that didnâ€™t impact outcomes, because Trump Admin & GOP was hawkish. Indeed,
in terms of actual policy, Biden Admin is slightly softer on Russia"

No recall elections. No issue voting. No referandums. No direct
democracy, until such time new tech / system does something
drastically different, not merely slaps some wizbang appendage on the
existing system which is not built for such granular
interaction. Current system should be (mostly is) centered around the
representatives.

---

No. Bcz I dont support issue voting in general.

"Would you support ranked choice voting on issues"

---

Great.. this new approach would also carry the legitimacy of a runoff
IMO. 

Politico: "Voting kicks off in a New York City mayor's race.. Voters
are trying out ranked-choice voting for the first time... The new
voting system [.. is] a way to avoid the cost and low turnout of
runoff elections. If no one wins a majority, then the last-place
finisher is eliminated and the second-place votes from those ballots
are redistributed to the remaining field. The process repeats itself
until someone breaks the 50 percent barrier"
