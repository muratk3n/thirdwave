The filibuster was never in the constitution, originated mostly by
accident, and has historically been used to block civil rights. No
legislatures on earth have a supermajority requirement because that’s
stupid and paralyzing. It’s time to trash the Jim Crow filibuster"

I got vaccinated at the new FEMA site in Brooklyn today, and one thing
I didn’t expect was just how good it would feel seeing the kind of
mass public mobilization that’s been missing for the last year ...

The site is running like clockwork and just cranking through the
vaccinations, must've done hundreds in the 15 mins I was there. Was
staffed by a huge number of really delightful National Guard people
from all over the country - the people who gave me my shot were from
Georgia"

Our anatomy has largely remained unchanged in the past 300K years, so
yes, human history is much longer.

Hah.. says "fig as old as humanity itself".. Another case of confusing
agro history with real history. We lived thousands of years before
this age.. doesnt that count? (Fig is only 5000 yrs old)

The unemployment measurement problem was known at the FED, among the

talks about alternative measurements proposed by the officials
themselves over the years.
