"In a recent post on Twitter VW CEO criticized hydrogen #fuelcell cars
and Glickenhaus challenged him to a race in the upcoming Baja 1000"

Not making a public spat with ISR probably made sense. Publicly
shitting on them cld push the muckers to more attacks.. The 2014
"conflict" lasted for 50 days after all, Biden surely remembered that.

---

Noticed that myself.. cld be significant

The Atlantic: "In a conflict where words matter (so much so that even
using the word conflict invites disagreement), it‚Äôs notable when the
words used begin to change.. a subtle, and perhaps more revealing,
shift has come from the White House.. In an address announcing
yesterday‚Äôs cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, President Joe Biden
said, 'Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and
securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and
democracy'"

"Robert Redfield, director of the [CDC, himself a virologist] under
Trump, recently said he believes that a lab leak is the most likely
explanation of how the pandemic started"

---

"You cannot make sense of the firmness with which the lab leak
hypothesis was dismissed without appreciating how Trump changed
American media. After the 2016 election, the top tier of American
media traded objectivity for opposition. As the New York Times has
more or less admitted, normal standards no longer applied. Success was
now defined by the extent to which you made Donald Trump‚Äôs life
difficult"

Jacobin: "Palestine Is No Longer the Third Rail for Democrats.. For
decades, the US media and political class have parroted Israel‚Äôs
claims of victimhood, despite Israel being an occupying state power
acting against an occupied people. The details change, but the story
remains the same: Israeli forces attack civilians.. In the wake of
these latest strikes, however, this consensus may finally be
crumbling"

Politico: "After months of letting their power to obstruct go unused,
the Senate GOP is ready to filibuster legislation creating a Jan. 6
commission. If Republicans follow through, they'll spark a
long-building fight over the filibuster‚Äôs very existence"

Netanyahu did all of this...he needed a war to save himself'"
