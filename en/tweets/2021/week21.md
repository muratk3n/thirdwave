"What this means, in non-technical language, is that Shi [Zheng-li at
the Wuhan Institute of Virology] set out to create novel coronaviruses
with the highest possible infectivity for human cells... 'It is also
clear .. that, depending on the constant genomic contexts chosen for
analysis, this work could have produced SARS-CoV-2 or a proximal
progenitor of SARS-CoV-2.' [said researcher from Rutgers] ..

The lab escape scenario for the origin of the SARS2 virus, as should
by now be evident, is not mere hand-waving in the direction of the
Wuhan Institute of Virology. It is a detailed proposal, based on the
specific project being funded there by the NIAID"

"California coalition aims to make hydrogen power cost-competitive by 2030.. 

HyDeal Los Angeles, a green hydrogen initiative launched in Los
Angeles on Monday, aims to bring the cost of hydrogen fuel to $1.50/kg
by 2030. At that price, to achieve 100% renewable energy, blended
electricity from a hydrogen-fueled turbine and long term low cost wind
and solar PPAs could run about 35 dollars/MWh"

That much-awaited [decoupling](2021/03/goods-materials-growth-hickel.md#decouple)
did not take place. In the umpteenth step of a fully fledged knowledge econ (3W),
maybe, it cld happen. But we are far off from that.

"But there are ways of growing without material extraction"

"In discussions of climate emergency, degrowth has always been the
elephant in the room; acknowledged from time to time, but rarely
spoken about. But it may be the only solution..

To address this omission, researchers .. recently¬†published an array
of degrowth pathways.. These show that an intentional reduction in
economic output is actually less risky than a combination of continued
GDP growth and geo-engineering. In advanced economies, degrowth would
involve a slowdown in manufacturing, accompanied by a significant
switch to green technologies and far greater focus on environmental
and ecological protection and repair.

If managed effectively, there would be no need for productivity to
fall, nor for people to become worse off. Embracing both a universal
basic income and a four-day working week would make the transition
relatively painless. Of course, a new smartphone model every year
would be out of the question, but would we really miss it?"

There u go.. even the f-ing CCP figured it out

Bcz due to loss of GDP, "growth"? Two ways to increase GDP, either
through more ppl, eg immigration, 2% more ppl 2% more growth which is
"dumb growth". Or you produce more per person, GDP Per Capita
increases, even w same amount of people (or a few skilled immigrants),
GDP increases, through knowhow = good growth.

No growth is also an option.

MSM is plugged into all sorts of places. Of course they heard the alternative theory

"[I]nside the Times, we were sharply divided.¬†My colleagues who cover
national security were being assured by their Trump administration
sources ‚Äî albeit anonymously and with no hard evidence ‚Äî that it was a
lab leak and the Chinese were covering it up. We science reporters
were hearing from virologists [the opposite]"

Not making a public spat with ISR probably made sense. Publicly
shitting on them cld push the muckers to more attacks.. The 2014
"conflict" lasted for 50 days after all, Biden surely remembered that.

Noticed that myself.. cld be significant

The Atlantic: "In a conflict where words matter (so much so that even
using the word conflict invites disagreement), it‚Äôs notable when the
words used begin to change.. a subtle, and perhaps more revealing,
shift has come from the White House.. In an address announcing
yesterday‚Äôs cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, President Joe Biden
said, 'Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and
securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and
democracy'"

"Robert Redfield, director of the [CDC, himself a virologist] under
Trump, recently said he believes that a lab leak is the most likely
explanation of how the pandemic started"

---

"You cannot make sense of the firmness with which the lab leak
hypothesis was dismissed without appreciating how Trump changed
American media. After the 2016 election, the top tier of American
media traded objectivity for opposition. As the New York Times has
more or less admitted, normal standards no longer applied. Success was
now defined by the extent to which you made Donald Trump‚Äôs life
difficult"
