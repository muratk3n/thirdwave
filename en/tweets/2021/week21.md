Texas has so many additional taxes that its burden is actually higher
than California's for middle-class people. California's taxes on rich
people are significantly higher than Texas. That's actually why GOP
commentators whine about CA taxes"

He makes too heavy use of knowledge abt / around black holes - which

Cant improve stuff while relying on garbage. As a software saying goes
"garbage in, garbage out".

"Eric Verlinde also attemps to explain dark matter"

---

Newton didn't have any deeper insight into why the laws are the way
they are. He tried bunch of stuff, certain formulas worked better (on
data) than others. That's it. With what we know now, with more
experimental data, and other areas of sci, you could surely modify
Newton.

"How is it possible to modify Newton's theories?"

---

Go for it. Dont worry if it has mismatches with early universe
theories.  Scientists have no idea what the f--k is going on there

"Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a hypothesis that proposes a
modification of Newton's laws to account for observed properties of
galaxies. It is an alternative to the hypothesis of dark matter in
terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently
understood laws of physics"

---

That number is global estimation of all reserves, currently used or
not. So this Nevada place did not expand the total, it is within the
total. The lithium is still insufficient. 

"You said lithium reserves are at ~17 million tonnes and are not enough
for green energy consumption. There, they found some new in Nevada"

Sometimes all it takes to shift a conclusion is modifying one
underlying assumption.. It's true modern world is based on many little
pieces coming together and there usually isnt enough time to question
every piece otherwise u cant move forward.. But for a certain kind of
analysis, u have to be able to - else, no progress.

"What this means, in non-technical language, is that Shi [Zheng-li at
the Wuhan Institute of Virology] set out to create novel coronaviruses
with the highest possible infectivity for human cells... 'It is also
clear .. that, depending on the constant genomic contexts chosen for
analysis, this work could have produced SARS-CoV-2 or a proximal
progenitor of SARS-CoV-2.' [said researcher from Rutgers] ..

The lab escape scenario for the origin of the SARS2 virus, as should
by now be evident, is not mere hand-waving in the direction of the
Wuhan Institute of Virology. It is a detailed proposal, based on the
specific project being funded there by the NIAID"

That much-awaited [decoupling](../../2021/03/goods-materials-growth-hickel.md#decouple)
did not take place. In the umpteenth step of a fully fledged knowledge econ (3W),
maybe, it cld happen. But we are far off from that.

"In discussions of climate emergency, degrowth has always been the
elephant in the room; acknowledged from time to time, but rarely
spoken about. But it may be the only solution..

To address this omission, researchers .. recently¬†published an array
of degrowth pathways.. These show that an intentional reduction in
economic output is actually less risky than a combination of continued
GDP growth and geo-engineering. In advanced economies, degrowth would
involve a slowdown in manufacturing, accompanied by a significant
switch to green technologies and far greater focus on environmental
and ecological protection and repair.

If managed effectively, there would be no need for productivity to
fall, nor for people to become worse off. Embracing both a universal
basic income and a four-day working week would make the transition
relatively painless. Of course, a new smartphone model every year
would be out of the question, but would we really miss it?"

Bcz due to loss of GDP, "growth"? Two ways to increase GDP, either
through more ppl, eg immigration, 2% more ppl 2% more growth which is
"dumb growth". Or you produce more per person, GDP Per Capita
increases, even w same amount of people (or a few skilled immigrants),
GDP increases, through knowhow = good growth.

No growth is also an option.

"[I]nside the Times, we were sharply divided.¬†My colleagues who cover

sources ‚Äî albeit anonymously and with no hard evidence ‚Äî that it was a
lab leak and the Chinese were covering it up. We science reporters
were hearing from virologists [the opposite]"

Noticed that myself.. cld be significant

The Atlantic: "In a conflict where words matter (so much so that even
using the word conflict invites disagreement), it‚Äôs notable when the
words used begin to change.. a subtle, and perhaps more revealing,
shift has come from the White House.. In an address announcing
yesterday‚Äôs cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, President Joe Biden
said, 'Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and
securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and
democracy'"

"You cannot make sense of the firmness with which the lab leak
hypothesis was dismissed without appreciating how Trump changed
American media. After the 2016 election, the top tier of American
media traded objectivity for opposition. As the New York Times has
more or less admitted, normal standards no longer applied. Success was
now defined by the extent to which you made Donald Trump‚Äôs life
difficult"
