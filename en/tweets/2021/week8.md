"APA Group ... announced a plan to make a 43 kilometre section of its
Parmelia gas pipeline in Western Australia 100 per cent ready to
transport hydrogen"

Of course the "battery" tech mentioned here uses H2 combined with a
metal hydride. It is basically creating renewable fuel internally, on
demand.

This speaks to the versatility of the approach.. H2 can be stored in
huge amounts, transported with ease, and in certain type of usages,
yes, it can also act like a battery.

"With Texan power outages hitting the headlines this week, it‚Äôs worth
looking to a startup that‚Äôs developed the world‚Äôs first renewable,
hydrogen-powered energy storage system. At full charge, it can furnish
a house with electricity for about three days"

"South Australia has met 100% of its electricity demands with solar
energy for the first time over the weekend‚Äîmost of it coming not from
solar farms but PV panels mounted on rooftops"

True, libs have their own party in UK. 

Jacobin: "A major reason why the US welfare state is so meager, its
union movement so frail, and its working class so divided is that the
United States is the only advanced capitalist democracy where parties
of big business have always monopolized the political arena. The
morbid symptoms of this impasse are everywhere today, from the rise of
Trumpism, to the Democratic establishment‚Äôs stubborn opposition to
Medicare for All in the midst of a pandemic, to the deepening
polarization of national politics along partisan lines free from any
focus on redistributing wealth and power.

Identifying this problem, unfortunately, has proven to be much easier
than effectively overcoming it. ...

Like the United States today, the UK had an entrenched two-party
system in which the Liberal Party was politically hegemonic over
workers and their organizations in the late nineteenth century. Aiming
to win over the Libs‚Äô working-class base, socialists avoided the twin
perils of marginalization and co-optation by organizing in and against
the party, building workplace militancy, confronting establishment
Liberals when possible, and allying with them when necessary.

The result was a decades-long dirty break, culminating in the founding
of the Labour Party in 1906 and its displacement of the Liberals"

"Both *Ghostbusters* and its sequel were a perfect encapsulation of
Ronald Reagan‚Äôs 1980s, and the two movies reflect the ambivalent and
inchoate resentments of a rapidly deindustrializing working class. But
the most important ‚Äî and culturally significant ‚Äî embodiment of the
'Me First' decade in Ghostbusters was a small, pudgy green ghost who
eventually became known as 'Slimer.' ...

Instead of Slimer, Afterlife‚Äôs creators have given us Muncher, a
blobbish ghost who looks like Gudetama joined the Blue Man Group and
became carbuncular with tumors. Where Slimer was joy, Muncher is
depression; where Slimer was sex, Muncher is abstinence; where Slimer
gave his captors a run for their money, Muncher is snail-like; where
Slimer was booze and cocaine, Muncher is ketamine and opioids; and,
most important, where Slimer devoured with hedonistic abandon, Muncher
merely munches.

If Slimer was the Marquis de Sade, Muncher is a basement-dwelling
failson. Sluggish and anhedonic, neutered and soft, the big blue ghost
is the perfect embodiment of our era of permanent decline, in which
every downwardly mobile middle-class American has become lobotomized
by the internet and unsustainable consumption"

Yea, typical output of 5 kw cannot drive such a system

"An electric furnace is a type of heating system which utilizes
electricity to heat the home, often using a fan to provide forced-air
through the home's ducts. It is generally more expensive to heat a
home using electricity rather than natural gas or other [wink wink H2]
sources of fuel. The cost of running an electric furnace varies
significantly depending on the size of the home, the type of electric
furnace used, cost of electricity, and the climate. Electric furnaces
range from 10 kilowatts to 50 kilowatts, we estimate that a 2,400
square foot home using a modern high efficiency electric furnace uses
18,000 watts for heating when the furnace is being used"

This confirms what's known from caravans, campervans, motorhomes;
batteries are for non-essential appliances, Nintendo, Playstation
console or whatever, but for anything serious, AC, heating, oven, they
have a gas based solution.

"If you‚Äôre one of those homeowners looking to add a home battery
system to your solar installation .. things you should know
... Whole-home backup protection is not possible for very long. No
residential storage system on the market has enough power and storage
capacity to run an entire home, regardless of their
advertising... Most homes use between 20 and 60 amps or more of power
per hour. High-amperage appliances like air conditioning, electric
ovens, and electric water heaters use massive amounts of power when
running, so whole-home backup is not realistic with today‚Äôs battery
and inverter technology. What the right system can do is keep your
lights and your critical appliances on long enough to get you through
a blackout and have your solar panels recharge your battery the next
day"
