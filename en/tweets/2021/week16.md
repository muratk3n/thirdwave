pipelines.

No wonder, under the crust there is magma, at 1000° C degrees, only
the Sun itself is hotter (5000° C). Hell the inner Earth core is as
hot as the Sun! So theoretically it is unlimited energy. Challanges
are drilling, finding pockets close enough.

---

"Geothermal power has considerable potential for growth. The amount of
heat within 10 000 metres of the earth's surface is estimated to
contain 50 000 times more energy than all oil and gas resources
worldwide (Shere, 2013). Moreover, there is a strong economic case for
the deployment of geothermal energy"

Some World War 4 level shit going on down there..

Force feeding?

The wonders of running a country with weak democracy -- u get to
decide whether to force feed a guy or not.

"Putin critic Navalny 'will not be allowed to die in
prison'... Russia's ambassador to the UK says opposition leader Alexei
Navalny's medical treatment will be "taken care of""

Im going to guess the latter shot locations resulted in less
interesting games

Both Coinbase and DFinity are backed by a16z oddly enough

---

Market did right on this one, Coinbase offers services for many
different cryptos, it's not tied down to any single shitcoin.

"Coinbase's IPO Lived Up to the Hype"

---

Ethereum DApps arguably offers distributed apps but their platform
emerged out of another (badly designed) crypto. Its founder is not an
system architecture guy.. I remember hearing performance issues a
while back. Better to start clean slate for distributed apps, then
plop on there whatever apps 1 might like or need.

---

Crypto mining is there to encourage people to share their computing
resources with the network right? First of all, Nano proved you can
have a crypto without mining, but, let's say u need computing
resources for additional services. Then, wouldnt a computing
environment that promises constant availability of such resources, and
offers them peer-to-peer, be a better fit for a crypto? I am thinking
of DFinity Internet Computer right now.. A crypto would be just
another app on such a platform. There will be chat app, social net
app, and crypto app.

Man geo mapping with some tools is a pain in the ass.. Leaflet.js is a
lightweight, relatively new approach tho, I like it. For Py access,
Folium.

CH doesnt have to lie on its GDP numbers; the number could be
"juiced", based on dumb expenditure, not innovation. Wanna double GDP,
build another ghost city. Dig up holes, fill them back up again. Done.

---

Approximating like a boss

---

Reminder:

1) Long-range over land H2 pipelines can transport 10 times more
energy than long-distance electricity transmission lines at one eight
the cost.

2) There are already 1,600 miles of H2 pipelines in US.

Proven tech.

@PplsCityCouncil

... we give LAPD $3 billion every year! They have already shot 14
people this year.

---


If more work was offloaded to other kinds of social workers, than
there'd be less need for police, than less funds for them; ergo it'd
be *defunding the police*. Notice this is not the same as saying "f..k
the police", merely reducing the need for the police.

"@theappeal

A new study suggests large chunks of police work can be safely
transitioned to non-police public safety workers: Across five cities,
between 23 and 45 percent of 911 calls were for issues like noise
complaints, disorderly conduct, and wellness checks"

DC requires mining too.. incredibly stupid. Crypto should not require
mining, and it should allow its money base to expand, ad infinitum

"Dogecoin spikes 400% in a week, stoking fears of a cryptocurrency
bubble.. Defying all odds, dogecoin is now worth $40 billion, and its
price has risen by a whopping 300% in the last seven days"
