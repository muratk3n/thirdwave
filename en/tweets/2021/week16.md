"Nikola Corp. (NASDAQ: NKLA), its European joint venture manufacturing
partner IVECO and German pipeline company OGE will work together to
transport hydrogen to stations serving commercial fuel cell electric
vehicles (FCEVs). The 124-mile natural gas pipeline network will move
hydrogen from where it is produced to hydrogen stations. Nikola will
not begin heavy-duty fuel cell truck production until late 2022...

'We believe this collaboration, in particular, presents a very
compelling long-term fueling distribution solution that we expect to
advance industry and overall market adoption of FCEV technologies,'
Nikola President of Energy and Commercial Pablo Koziner said in a
press release"

"One country that has already seen significant growth in fuel cell
usage is South Korea. *Power* [magazine] reported on three new
electricity generating facilities based on fuel cell technology that
were deployed in South Korea last summer: a 50-MW power plant placed
in ...  Seosan, a 19.8-MW installation in Hwasung, and an 8.1-MW
facility in Paju. 'Part of the magic that we‚Äôre seeing in Korea as it
relates to stationary power using fuel cells is incentives,' said Joe
Cargnelli, director of engineering for Cummins‚Äô Fuel Cell and Hydrogen
Technologies division. ‚ÄúWhat Korea has done is they‚Äôve created
essentially the feed-in tariff for fuel cells‚Äîfor stationary fuel
cells. So, if you think back to how solar energy and wind energy got
started back in the mid-90s, it was through a solar feed-in tariff and
a wind tariff, and it started in Germany and kind of caught on, and
that‚Äôs what sort of gave solar and wind their start. Korea has done
that for fuel cells and stationary power. So, they have incentives
that promote the deployment of stationary fuel cells and [they‚Äôve
been] highly successful, and I think it‚Äôs a great strategy.'"

What defines whether a country becomes democratic or authoratic? Geo
plays a role? Russia's rivers flow in the [wrong direction](2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.md#rurivers).
Geo forms a big obstacle, then the state has to help more, then
later becomes a burden itself?

Still no excuse to get stuck where u r, utilize tech, strenghten infra, and
democratize.. 

---

Navalny has a feel for working the media, public opinion.. He rode the
momentum after his recovery, w that Putin's Palace stuff, then his
travel back to Russia, clearly with an eye towards US since the new
admin talked about not accommodating autocrats.. Whatever the tactics
though, one cannot deny he is fighting for democracy, and willing to
put his life on the line for it.

No wonder, under the crust there is magma, at 1000¬∞ C degrees, only
the Sun itself is hotter (5000¬∞ C). Hell the inner Earth core is as
hot as the Sun! So theoretically it is unlimited energy. Challanges
are drilling, finding pockets close enough.

---

"Geothermal power has considerable potential for growth. The amount of
heat within 10 000 metres of the earth's surface is estimated to
contain 50 000 times more energy than all oil and gas resources
worldwide (Shere, 2013). Moreover, there is a strong economic case for
the deployment of geothermal energy"

Both Coinbase and DFinity are backed by a16z oddly enough

---

Market did right on this one, Coinbase offers services for many
different cryptos, it's not tied down to any single shitcoin.

"Coinbase's IPO Lived Up to the Hype"

---

Ethereum DApps arguably offers distributed apps but their platform
emerged out of another (badly designed) crypto. Its founder is not an
system architecture guy.. I remember hearing performance issues a
while back. Better to start clean slate for distributed apps, then
plop on there whatever apps 1 might like or need.

---

Crypto mining is there to encourage people to share their computing
resources with the network right? First of all, Nano proved you can
have a crypto without mining, but, let's say u need computing
resources for additional services. Then, wouldnt a computing
environment that promises constant availability of such resources, and
offers them peer-to-peer, be a better fit for a crypto? I am thinking
of DFinity Internet Computer right now.. A crypto would be just
another app on such a platform. There will be chat app, social net
app, and crypto app.

Approximating like a boss

Reminder:

1) Long-range over land H2 pipelines can transport 10 times more
energy than long-distance electricity transmission lines at one eight
the cost.

2) There are already 1,600 miles of H2 pipelines in US.

Proven tech.

@PplsCityCouncil

... we give LAPD $3 billion every year! They have already shot 14
people this year.

If more work was offloaded to other kinds of social workers, than
there'd be less need for police, than less funds for them; ergo it'd
be *defunding the police*. Notice this is not the same as saying "f..k
the police", merely reducing the need for the police.

"@theappeal

A new study suggests large chunks of police work can be safely
transitioned to non-police public safety workers: Across five cities,
between 23 and 45 percent of 911 calls were for issues like noise
complaints, disorderly conduct, and wellness checks"

DC requires mining too.. incredibly stupid. Crypto should not require
mining, and it should allow its money base to expand, ad infinitum
