Just looking at the shape of graph shows exp growth.

"@yashar

People keep asking why Navalny went back to Russia...some have called
it foolish. How do you think change happens? It doesn't happen from a
comfy apartment in Berlin or New York"

The trials and tribulations of Hawley is the perfect example why
fascism-lite, the so-called "populism", is unsustainable as an
ideology. Dude supported the Trump tax, then sided with Bernie on the
$2000 check, is for anti-trust and but then went batshit on election
fraud charges... He is a mess. This cant be the basis of Rep party, or
any party.. These people can only exist as a reaction to something
else.

Figures from the International Energy Agency reveal that global
low-carbon hydrogen production has increased from 0.04 million tonnes
in 2010 to 0.36 million tonnes in 2019, and is expected to reach 1.45
million tonnes in 2023"

"@Snowden

@Navalny's arrest seems to me a repetition of mistakes made in the
Soviet era, seen elsewhere now in the case against #Assange and the
war on whistleblowers. States are developing an allergy to
opposition—but systems that cannot accept dissent will not survive
it. Let him go"

Geometry should take backseat to other concerns.. It is a derivative
concept, not essential. In Wolfram's approach too, space, its
dimensions [emerge](https://youtu.be/-t1_ffaFXao?t=6555) out of his
hypergraph structure.

There was FF 1 then FF 2? But.. how does that connect to, like Blah
Movie 3? And that to Blah Blah 4?

After seeing decade long multi movie setups, old style mere "sequel"
sound so inconsequential.. tiny.

CSU guy, Söder. He was recently against "any expansion of the eurozone
to include countries like Bulgaria and Romania; the introduction of
Eurobonds; and the creation of a European finance minister
post". Daam.

The newly elected person is exact oppo no?

New CDU leader.  But it doesnt mean this person will be the chancellor
candidate for the general elections?

Dude from CSU comes across more of a leader... And word is he handled
covid well.

---

TR parties, coalitions still largely work this way.. they are
cesspools of proto fascism into which anything can be thrown in and it
floats, like certain shit does in a pool of piss.

---

Sure. 30s TR for example, during the single-party rule and staunch
nationalism one of its governors was known to have said "if communism
was necessary for this country, we would surely import it". Sounds
like a joke and it is told as such, but the guy was dead
serious. There you go, nationalist talking about utilizing
communism.. Or in China today, they are communists, but imported
capitalism, and happily using it. Italian fascists created the social
security system of the country.

Intensely opposing ideologies cannot be held together under one roof
in anything other than fascism.. A whatever-it-takes attitude usually
accompanies the approach, 4 whatever reason said country falls into a
state-of-emergency mentality from which they never emerge, so they
keep on living in an hand-to-mouth existence, "I'll take from here,
I'll take from there, whatever-it-takes, ends-justify-the-means", and
on it goes..

"Could you give more examples of fascism being a grab-bag of ideologies"
