# Week 3

They've been seeking for this f-ing thing for decades now.. and still
haven't found it?

Time to give up dude? Or no.. Just fudge another constant and move
on..?

The CERN presentation has a great title: "Desperately Seeking SUSY" ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤£

[shakes head in disbelief]

Unzicker: "The reason why the standard model cannot calculate mass is
stunningly simple. Whatever formula may calculate the mass of a
particle, it has to have the physical unit of a mass, which is
kilograms, and those kilograms have to come out of the formula, you
can't pull it out of your ass. The only way to do it is to find
combinations of the fundamental constants of Nature, otherwise you are
cheating. But there is no such combination, as every high school kid
can understand... There is just one caveat - you can't do it unless
you use the gravitational constant G, that is, you consider gravity in
your model. But particle physicists donâ€™t do it because gravity is a
difficult business that goes above their minds. Itâ€™s outright lunatic
that they declare that calculating masses, alas, is impossible in the
standard model and at the same time deliberately disregard gravity
which would offer the only possibility to try it"

"[Wilczek] has by now lost multiple bets that the LHC would see SUSY
particles, including ones with Garrett Lisi in 2009 and Tord EkelÃ¶f in 2012.
At this point, even diehards like Wilczek acknowledge that
chances that the LHC will see SUSY are slim. Another problem is that
increasingly sensitive proton decay experiments have also ruled out a
large part of the proton lifetimes predicted by the SUSY models
Wilczek favors"

Boeing did not only mess up on the control system of the MAX. They
messed up in the core aerodynamics first, they created a poorly
balanced plane, which they tried to fix using software. They made it
much easier for the control system to fail, basically.

People are awed and amazed at the electronics of these systems, but
let's not forget, during WW1 and and 2, planes could still fly without
any of these. Basic, solid aerodynamics made that possible. Now bunch
of office monkeys too used to their gadgetry and unrealistic computer
games think they can turn everything upside down, and "software" wld
take care of it. This is delusional / wishful thinking. This is the
mentality that gave you stagnant physics of decades, BEVs, IoT, errant
liberalism and lukewarm, ineffective politics with tech sparkle.

"'[R]ight now itâ€™s starting to look like [HFCs] are in the lead
[compared to battery electric-powered vehicles], and many experts
think that will continue,' said Matt Waller, the dean of the Sam
M. Walton College .. Waller said [they] could be better for the
environment than electric batteries because there isnâ€™t any poisonous
material to dispose of with hydrogen, and the only byproduct is water"

It's true, there is a bubble. [The Wilshire index](2019/05/stats.md#wilshire)
(total market cap / GDP) is very high.

Just looking at the shape of graph shows exp growth.

People keep asking why Navalny went back to Russia...some have called
it foolish. How do you think change happens? It doesn't happen from a
comfy apartment in Berlin or New York"

The trials and tribulations of Hawley is the perfect example why
fascism-lite, the so-called "populism", is unsustainable as an
ideology. Dude supported the Trump tax, then sided with Bernie on the
$2000 check, is for anti-trust and but then went batshit on election
fraud charges... He is a mess. This cant be the basis of Rep party, or
any party.. These people can only exist as a reaction to something
else.

"@Snowden

@Navalny's arrest seems to me a repetition of mistakes made in the
Soviet era, seen elsewhere now in the case against #Assange and the
war on whistleblowers. States are developing an allergy to
oppositionâ€”but systems that cannot accept dissent will not survive
it. Let him go"

Geometry should take backseat to other concerns.. It is a derivative
concept, not essential. In Wolfram's approach too, space, its

There was FF 1 then FF 2? But.. how does that connect to, like Blah
Movie 3? And that to Blah Blah 4?

After seeing decade long multi movie setups, old style mere "sequel"
sound so inconsequential.. tiny.

CSU guy, SÃ¶der. He was recently against "any expansion of the eurozone
to include countries like Bulgaria and Romania; the introduction of
Eurobonds; and the creation of a European finance minister
post". Daam.

The newly elected person is exact oppo no?

New CDU leader.  But it doesnt mean this person will be the chancellor
candidate for the general elections?

Dude from CSU comes across more of a leader... And word is he handled
covid well.

---

TR parties, coalitions still largely work this way.. they are
cesspools of proto fascism into which anything can be thrown in and it
floats, like certain shit does in a pool of piss.

---

Sure. 30s TR for example, during the single-party rule and staunch
nationalism one of its governors was known to have said "if communism
was necessary for this country, we would surely import it". Sounds
like a joke and it is told as such, but the guy was dead
serious. There you go, nationalist talking about utilizing
communism.. Or in China today, they are communists, but imported
capitalism, and happily using it. Italian fascists created the social
security system of the country.

Intensely opposing ideologies cannot be held together under one roof
in anything other than fascism.. A whatever-it-takes attitude usually
accompanies the approach, 4 whatever reason said country falls into a
state-of-emergency mentality from which they never emerge, so they
keep on living in an hand-to-mouth existence, "I'll take from here,
I'll take from there, whatever-it-takes, ends-justify-the-means", and
on it goes..

"Could you give more examples of fascism being a grab-bag of ideologies"
