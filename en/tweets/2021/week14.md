BTC specifically is badly designed but the next crypto cld remedy
that, fix the warts.

---

Maybe 1 cld see a crypto as holding a ticket that gets u into a
payment system, and the system is the value.. It is sorta circular
tho.. why would someone want to pay with a crypto? Bcz there are
others on it.. U get on it, then more might choose it for payments..

NR never runs out of ways of hitting this thing, BTC.

Water is more abundant and easy to process, jagoff. Even if water was

Unions [lost a lot of power](2019/08/focus-group-democracy.md) after
70s. The left sufered due to losing org structure and
leadership. Politicians themselves like that single contact to be
lobbied by, u cant have bunch of random ppl running around trying to
make policy, some kind of filter is necessary.

BTW the so-called Turkish coffee is actually Greek coffee, and that
itself is similar to a espresso, clearly all originating from
Aegy/Medi region; bunch of punks from distant whereever did not bring

who arrived and assimilated, picked these things up from their region.

Words like "summation" can be misleading.. We are computing a "smart
sum", a sum that takes into account the upper boundary. Or a [smart
multiplication](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-calculus-analogy-integrals-as-multiplication/).

---

How about the top part? They are not the same. Their upper boundary
changes as we go to right, depending on the function we are
integrating, so it's not simple sum.

Pay attn that integration result too, anything above first degree will
give you polynomial of deg higher and including than 2 = nonlinearity.

Sure I tie lots of thing into a digi payment, eg UBI. Monetary system
is at the center of many things \#muneee

---

Patreon is not good enough, ppl still have to signup to this
particular service. Monetized likes, naming all needs to be integrated
into an omnipresent payment scheme.

---

Docu shows challenges around paying for content in a post-industrial
era. My take: we need voluntery, "monetized likes" scheme tied to a
new crypto. Fast payment tech, connect to a naming system (akin to
Twitter checkmark), then while listening to a song (downloaded from
.. wherever), if liked, u send small payment to just a name. Bee Gees?
Weekend? Send it to that name and it gets routed to the artist. Or
even send it to a work (a song, or a movie), and payment gets divided
up automatically behind the scenes according to a formula.
