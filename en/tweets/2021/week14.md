Sure I tie lots of thing into a digi payment, eg UBI. Monetary system
is at the center of many things \#muneee

---

Patreon is not good enough, ppl still have to signup to this
particular service. Monetized likes, naming all needs to be integrated
into an omnipresent payment scheme.

Docu shows challenges around paying for content in a post-industrial
era. My take: we need voluntery, "monetized likes" scheme tied to a
new crypto. Fast payment tech, connect to a naming system (akin to
Twitter checkmark), then while listening to a song (downloaded from
.. wherever), if liked, u send small payment to just a name. Bee Gees?
Weekend? Send it to that name and it gets routed to the artist. Or
even send it to a work (a song, or a movie), and payment gets divided
up automatically behind the scenes according to a formula.

Archimedes circle area formula invention is not covered at
schools.. Sad state of our ed system.. Stuff that should be taught
first arrives last. It is as if they don't want innovative,
free-thinking people.

"I read somewhere that Calculus is all about dividing something into
pieces and putting it back together.. In terms of the basis of
innovation, doesn't that sound like simple addition?"

---

It's true. [See](../../2021/04/suez-aftermath-ike-didnt-like.md)

'Years later,' Richard Nixon wrote in the 1980s, 'I talked to
Eisenhower about Suez; he told me it was his major foreign policy
mistake.'"

Were they waiting for muneee? The Benjamins?

A year ago? Why did it take so long for a wider rollout?  Testing
shouldn't have taken that long.
