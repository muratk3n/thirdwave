Too bad the Amazon unionization effort failed.. But 'ppl have spoken'
is the wrong conclusion to draw here.. The system was favoring the
employer. Change of labor laws needed? AMZN clearly was the better
closer.

Code

Flip the actors u can see the build-up (code 154) both ways.

Code 154 is "mobilization or increase of armed forces"

```python
import pandas as pd, zipfile
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth',-1)

dates = ['0331','0401'] # add more dates here w files

for dt in dates:
    with zipfile.ZipFile('gdelt/2021%s.export.CSV.zip' % dt, 'r') as z:
         df = pd.read_csv(z.open('2021%s.export.CSV' % dt),sep='\t',header=None)
    print (len(df.columns))
    urls = df[57]
    cols = ['GlobalEventID', 'Day', 'MonthYear', 'Year', 'FractionDate',\
           'Actor1Code', 'Actor1Name', 'Actor1CountryCode', 'Actor1KnownGroupCode',\
           'Actor1EthnicCode', 'Actor1Religion1Code', 'Actor1Religion2Code',\
           'Actor1Type1Code', 'Actor1Type2Code', 'Actor1Type3Code', \
           'Actor2Code', 'Actor2Name', 'Actor2CountryCode', 'Actor2KnownGroupCode',
           'Actor2EthnicCode', 'Actor2Religion1Code', 'Actor2Religion2Code',
           'Actor2Type1Code', 'Actor2Type2Code', 'Actor2Type3Code', \
           'IsRootEvent','EventCode', 'EventBaseCode']
    df2 = df[range(len(cols))]
    df2.columns = cols

    flt = (df2.EventCode==154) & (df2.Actor1Code=='RUS') & (df2.Actor2Code=='UKR')
    print (dt)
    df3 = df2[flt]
    if not df3.empty:
        print (df3[['Actor1Code','Actor2Code','EventCode','EventBaseCode']])
        url3 = urls[flt]
        print (url3)
```

I looked at GDELT [event files](http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/),
going back go March 1st; did not find any initial Ukraine
movement. The first time any build-up is reported in the region, in
the 1/3-1/4 timeframe, was April 1, by RUS. One of the news links
parsed by GDELT is [here](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/top-us-general-calls-russia-ukraine-amid-reported-moscow-troop-buildup/).

"In terms of the latest escalation, who is responsible? Who deployed
its military first?  Russia or Ukraine?"

Maybe the mechanical vs wild animal theme in scifi movies is a
throwback to that feeling, way of coping with insane recent
advances. It was mysterious to be scared of the beast? Now smaller
ones are causing more damage.

Largest whale in length, 30 meters. Aircraft carrier, over 300 meters
in length.  The masses dont even compare. Whale has no chance. Its
funny from a time where humans were afraid of monsters at sea, now we
have monsters of our own.

"Could a whale damage a ship? Like an aircraft carrier?"

"US senators on Thursday unveiled broad legislation on China that would
step up pressure over Beijing's alleged theft of intellectual property
and solidify US ties with Taiwan.

In a rare bipartisan initiative in the polarized Congress, the top
Democrat and Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
together presented the Strategic Competition Act which aims to govern
the fraught US relationship with Beijing.

'The United States government must be clear-eyed and sober about
Beijing's intentions and actions, and calibrate our policy and
strategy accordingly,' said Senator Bob Menendez, the Democrat who
leads the committee"

Beckley: "Historically, when fast-growing great powers slow down, they
do not mellow out. Instead, they become more repressive at home and
aggressive abroad. They crack down on domestic dissent and expand
overseas to find new sources of wealth, rally citizens around the
ruling regime, and deter foreign rivals from exploiting their economic
problems. China is already on this pathâ€”as its growth slows, it is
repressing freedom in the mainland and in Hong Kong, ramping up
pressure on Taiwan, colonizing the South China Sea, building the
largest navy in the world, and buying assets and building ports all
over the world"
