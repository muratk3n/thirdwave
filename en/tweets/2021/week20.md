These organized groups are being also led by the Jewish supremacist,
MP Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is currently on his way to Lod with hundreds
of supporters... The police cannot block him.. Just a few nights ago,
they burnt down Arab businesses"

the nation of their birth. The idea that it's even remotely
controversial to call what Israel has imposed on Palestinians a form
of apartheid is laughable'"

Jacobin: "Last month, Washington State passed a capital gains tax
aimed at the state's ultra-wealthy. The tax is historic because
Washington, despite its progressive reputation, until now had the

Florida, and South Dakota"

Some pages are several MB in size.. nobody optimizes this stuff
anymore? No wonder monkeys need 5G

Wrote little browser tool w `bs4` to filter out all visual elements of
a page leaving the plain text behind. Great for low bandwidth
browsing. Intermittency. Raw content over presentation. Da thing

Despite the general centrist, establishment stance not sure CNN is
overly fond of Israel.. One reporter had a very public spat there
years back. I think the whole Netanyahu shtick, the Sheldon Adelson
connection, right-wing fuckery is a bit too much, even for them.

NYT: "A spokesman led the international media to believe that Israeli
forces had entered Gaza. They hadn't. But the army wanted Hamas to
think they had.. The intent, the media reports said, was to dupe Hamas
fighters into thinking that an invasion had begun and to respond in
ways that would expose far greater numbers of them to what was being
called a devastatingly lethal Israeli attack.... [MSM...] had
mistakenly reported a ground invasion early Friday [asked] whether
they had been turned into accessories to the military, why it had
taken hours for the invasion report to be reversed, and how they would
be able to trust the military's statements going forward"

"@istanbultelaviv

The Minister of Public Security Amir Ohana, together w/Netanyahu, is
responsible for the total breakdown of security. Had he instructed the
police force to act differently in Jerusalem during Ramadan, it is
hard to imagine we'd be where we are today. That is the truth"

"In 1949, a Polish Holocaust survivor named Genya Kowalski was offered
a Palestinian house in Haifa. She refused, saying: 'I don’t want to
live [in a house] of people who were thrown out...a human being is a
human being.' We can be her heirs today" via @samseder
