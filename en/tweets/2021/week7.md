Wind turbine freezing was not the main factor then.. 

"@GregAbbott_TX

The Texas power grid has not been compromised.

The ability of some companies that generate the power has been frozen. 

This includes the natural gas & coal generators.

They are working to get generation back on line"

They apparently installed a remote access software so system could be
controlled from anywhere... But if something is accessible, connected
to the Net, hackers can also access

They need to take that shite off the Internet.

If an area as large as Texas was covered with panels today, it would
[provide](2019/05/bezos-space-infrastructure.md#energy) ample energy,
twice of what is required actually, for the entire world.

Colonization fine for other things, not urgent for energy.

Any gov trusting their regulatory pizzazz should think again. VW
emission cheat happened under gov which wasnt known for widespread
incomp, done by a company from a country associated with *ordnung*.

---

As policy megawatt scale of this tech to be used at a few power plants
is fine, easy to regulate. End-user level, no. Much harder to control,
and if reg is flaunted, side effects would be severe.

End-user gets the renewable fuel, ditto for pipelines.

"Bloom also intends to complete work on technology capable of
capturing and extracting carbon from the emissions of its
natural-gas-powered fuel cells. The company is 'working very hard to
demonstrate' the ability to combine 'blue hydrogen' production, or
turning methane into hydrogen and capturing the carbon emissions, with
electricity production"

You have to watch for these tech types.. even when they're scaring
you, they might be selling you. Like 'be scared of AI, boo!', the
indirect message being it is *that good*. U see.. ? Then seque into
'i've got some of that same tech that for your house, for your
lawnmower'.. (but no worries i had my people write it, and im the
caution guy here, so be afraid for other stuff but not my shit, and
buy it, quick!)'. So sad.. and bunk.

Some earthquake plotting.. EQ of past 90 days, old to new is colored
light to dark, circle width is severity. The hope was maybe seeing a

"The H-Factor" üëç

"In a grand, clean energy strategy published in mid-December, a brain
trust of cross-sector Canadian savants predicted that hydrogen-powered
locomotion‚Äîalready nicknamed ‚Äúhydrail‚Äù‚Äîwould be ready for testing some
time about 2025, first in the form of yard switchers, short-leashed to
their refueling stations.

The very next day, Dec. 18, Canadian Pacific (CP) smashed that
timeline, and woke the North American rail industry"

Newton, other early modern phy computed all the time. It's fine to go
off in an abstract direction but most phy teaching by default must be
enmeshed with computation.

---

Landau wrote some fantastic books. Id listen to him.

Landau: "There can be little argument that computation has become an
essential element in all areas of physics, be it via simulation,
symbolic manipulations, data manipulations, equipment
interfacing... [E]ven though the style of teaching and organization of
subjects being taught by physics departments have changed in recent
times, the actual content of the courses has been slow to incorporate
the new-found importance of computation. Yes, there are now speciality
courses and many textbooks in Computational Physics, but that is not
the same thing as incorporating computation into the very heart of a
modern physics curriculum so that the physics being taught today more
closely resembles the physics being done today"

Creator is [more likely](2015/04/god.md)

"Which is likely? Creator or not?"

---

By turning something into a process, we dont automatically remove "an
omnipotent creator" from the picture. Everyone likes the invention of
evolution. "God did not create the final thing, it was an evolutionary
process". Boom. Darwin is world famous.

"Well now let's apply that to the universe".. thought some? "God did
not make it happen, it started from a small seed, turned into
everything we see"

Except the creator isnt exactly removed from the picture, ie the most
enthusiastic supporters of Big Bang were and are the Clergy. That one
one focused, 'big' creational event must have jelled more with their
view of the creator.

But an omnipo being can bring stuff into existence, close to what they
are now, just as easily as some magic process that will evolve stuff
into as they are now. Dont want to assume either way, what I am saying
is opting for long-running process just to remove the Big Guy is not
necessarily more scientific.
