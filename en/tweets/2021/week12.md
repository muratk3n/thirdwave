# Week 12

Lesson here for all teachers, dont dumb stuff down for shinier
delivery. Your jobs is to *demystify*, not creating a new level of
mystery around your character, your props, or whatever.

Carl Sagan had an [eduvid](https://youtu.be/G8cbIWMv0rI?t=333) on that
too. Not bad, but lemme tell u what you did wrong here Carl, forgot to
mention how stick angle translates to btw-city angle..

He is really rockin that brown jacket with the turtleneck tho. Very
disco, Studio 54, I dig it, but some stuff got lost during "the show".

Extend rays like below, implies angle between two cities is 7.2
relative to Earth center

Btw city angle is 7.2 out of 360 deg. He had a guy walk btw cities,
dist 5000 stadia = 800 km. Using angle ratio equalness to
circumference / city dist ratio,

```python
print ('%0.0f km' % (360/7.2 * 800))
```

```text
40000 km
```

This guy found a good approx for Earth circumference with f-ing
sticks, shadows, simple angle measurement, plus indirectly
debunked flat Earth hypo. Ella re malaka

Library as in the freaking Library of Alexandria

First approx calculation of Earth circumference, BC 200s. Oh
yeah. Erotosthenes (scientists, head librarian) heard from someone,
during summer solst., stick in Syene has no shadow, at noon. He tried
it in Alexandria (little north) saw shadow. Measured angle, 7.2
degrees,

earlier.

Vacc dev was too slow. The delay gave time to the virus to
mutate. Clda been done in a month, two tops.

Politico: "The Rocky Road to Bidencare — Fresh off securing the first
major expansion of Obamacare since the law’s passage a decade ago,
Democrats are dipping their toes into the next major health care
fight...  The health care industry is already trying to kill it. A
lobbying group backed by the industry is running state and national
ads against the idea"

What wld someone's first impression of Anthony Hopkins be? Classically
trained actor, has that posh accent, probably watches those artsy
movies all the time.. But the guy isnt like that.. He likes action. He
watches Schwarzenegger movies. He said so in an interview. So u
thought something abt the guy, but he was something else. He clearly
likes the genre, he keeps playing roles in them!

Calculating distance ratios for Moon and the Sun, ancient times.

Dude waited until it was half moon, then he knows Earth-Moon-Sun are
at right angle (light has to hit perfectly from one side for that half
shadow to happen),

<img width="340" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png"/>

Then he estimates angle $\varphi$, around 87 deg (point to one, then
swing arm to the other, angle covered is $\varphi$). Now u got your
right angle triangle, rest is basic trig, reverse of cos,
$1/\cos(\varphi)$

```python
"%0.2f" % (1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)))
```

```text
Out[1]: '19.11'
```

The sun is roughly 19 times further than the Moon.

I dont like ragging on govs on vaccs, I know many are doing their
best. But IMO we are stuck with some sucky infra, this cant be the
setup we meet the next pandemic with.
