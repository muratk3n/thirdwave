MovieLens keeps its ratings records relatvely up-to-date.. nice. Last
update was on 2018..  That cld be good enough..

The best way to see these "AI" products is as parrots. Like parrot can
speak, and make intelligable human-like sounds, and even say stuff on
occasion that seems to fit a certain mood, they cannot converse with
humans. These tools are trained with very specific aims in mind,
writing a story wld be a tough barrier to cross.

a big landmass with few people should count for something.. bcz it

Resillience is part of good tech, yes. Imagine having an electric
rifle and the shit runs out of battery in the middle of a skirmish..
That rifle would not be high tech, it'd just be dumb tech.

Sure the Sun is hotter than lava, but not a million times hotter. It's
only five times hotter.

---

Easy to intuit the Sun is liquid. What is the hottest natural thing we
know on Earth? It is lava. And lava is liquid, it flows. We know
this. So why do some so readily accept the gaseous hyphothsis?

Lesson here for all teachers, dont dumb stuff down for shinier

Carl Sagan had an [eduvid](https://youtu.be/G8cbIWMv0rI?t=333) on that
too. Not bad, but lemme tell u what you did wrong here Carl, forgot to
mention how stick angle translates to btw-city angle..

He is really rockin that brown jacket with the turtleneck tho. Very
disco, Studio 54, I dig it, but some stuff got lost during "the show".

Extend rays like below, implies angle between two cities is 7.2
relative to Earth center

<img width="340" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExBij1KXMAA5ekf?format=jpg&name=small"/>

Btw city angle is 7.2 out of 360 deg. He had a guy walk btw cities,
dist 5000 stadia = 800 km. Using angle ratio equalness to
circumference / city dist ratio,

```python
print ('%0.0f km' % (360/7.2 * 800))
```

```text
40000 km
```

This guy found a good approx for Earth circumference with f-ing
sticks, shadows, simple angle measurement, plus indirectly
debunked flat Earth hypo. Ella re malaka

yeah. Erotosthenes (scientists, head librarian) heard from someone,
during summer solst., stick in Syene has no shadow, at noon. He tried
it in Alexandria (little north) saw shadow. Measured angle, 7.2
degrees,

What wld someone's first impression of Anthony Hopkins be? Classically
trained actor, has that posh accent, probably watches those artsy
movies all the time.. But the guy isnt like that.. He likes action. He
watches Schwarzenegger movies. He said so in an interview. So u
thought something abt the guy, but he was something else. He clearly
likes the genre, he keeps playing roles in them!

Calculating distance ratios for Moon and the Sun, ancient times.

Dude waited until it was half moon, then he knows Earth-Moon-Sun are
at right angle (light has to hit perfectly from one side for that half
shadow to happen),

<img width="340" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png"/>

Then he estimates angle $\varphi$, around 87 deg (point to one, then
swing arm to the other, angle covered is $\varphi$). Now u got your
right angle triangle, rest is basic trig, reverse of cos,
$1/\cos(\varphi)$

```python
"%0.2f" % (1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)))
```

```text
Out[1]: '19.11'
```

The sun is roughly 19 times further than the Moon.
