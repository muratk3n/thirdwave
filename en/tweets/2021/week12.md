"The great seismic quiet period... Noise from trains, airplanes,
industrial processes, and other sources is recorded on seismometers
worldwide. Disentangling this noise is important for extracting out
natural signals [scientists] found a substantial decrease in noise
resulting from lockdown measures imposed in response to the
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"

Built by a French-Egypt company.

We are talking big construction in Egypt so of course ppl had to die
as in during the time of Pheroahs.

"[The Suez Canal construction took] 10 years. Digging the canal began
on April 25, 1859.. Around one million Egyptians, mostly peasants,
were recruited to do the job under harsh conditions including poor
wages.. They had to remove about 74 million cubic metres of
earth... Around 120,000 of the labour died in the process due to food
shortages, lack of health care and ill-treatment"

Using pre-recorded lectures will keep ed quality high. 

---

Record once, use everywhere. Govs can fund recording of such vids for
every subject, kids at school watch them over tablets. No more teachers
in the old sense of the word.

There will be "graders" not teachers in the new system. Grade is
pass/fail. Graders can hang around in study halls if they are not
grading (rare) both to keep it quite, and answer the occas questions
in their field.

---

I like this lecture format. You see the lecturer, and the equations
simply appear while he talks, parts gets highlighted for emphasis, and
necessary pieces get carried over to the next slide if
necessary. 3Blue1Brown style, which is all animation and lecturer
voice, is fine too but this one has more of a lecture feel to it.

Budding cosmologists.. this is where u can make a name 4
yourself. Disprove overabundance of helium, the whole house of cards
will come crushing down.

"‚ÄòPrimordial‚Äô helium levels strongly guide all solar helium abundance
determinations, as the amount of helium in the stars is said to be
closely correlated with the synthesis of this element soon after the
Big Bang. Helium abundances currently act as one of the 'Great
Pillars' of cosmology... As such, any attempt to alter accepted helium
levels within the Sun has great implications throughout astrophysics.
Recently, the author has reviewed the determination of solar helium
abundances and reached the conclusion that these levels are likely to
have been overstated. The most prudent outlook remains that the Sun,
like the visible universe, is composed primarily of hydrogen, as first
outlined by Cecilia Payne"

Extend rays like below, implies angle between two cities is 7.2
relative to Earth center

<img width="340" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExBij1KXMAA5ekf?format=jpg&name=small"/>

Btw city angle is 7.2 out of 360 deg. He had a guy walk btw cities,
dist 5000 stadia = 800 km. Using angle ratio equalness to
circumference / city dist ratio,

```python
print ('%0.0f km' % (360/7.2 * 800))

Calculating distance ratios for Moon and the Sun, ancient times.

Dude waited until it was half moon, then he knows Earth-Moon-Sun are
at right angle (light has to hit perfectly from one side for that half
shadow to happen),

<img width="340" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png"/>

Then he estimates angle $\varphi$, around 87 deg (point to one, then
swing arm to the other, angle covered is $\varphi$). Now u got your
right angle triangle, rest is basic trig, reverse of cos,
$1/\cos(\varphi)$

```python
"%0.2f" % (1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)))
```

```text
Out[1]: '19.11'
```

The sun is roughly 19 times further than the Moon.
