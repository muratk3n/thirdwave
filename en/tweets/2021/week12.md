What wld someone's first impression of Anthony Hopkins be? Classically
trained actor, has that posh accent, probably watches those artsy
movies all the time.. But the guy isnt like that.. He likes action. He
watches Schwarzenegger movies. He said so in an interview. So u
thought something abt the guy, but he was something else. He clearly
likes the genre, he keeps playing roles in them!

Calculating distance ratios for Moon and the Sun, ancient times.

Dude waited until it was half moon, then he knows Earth-Moon-Sun are
at right angle (light has to hit perfectly from one side for that half
shadow to happen),

<img width="340" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png"/>

Then he estimates angle $\varphi$, around 87 deg (point to one, then
swing arm to the other, angle covered is $\varphi$). Now u got your
right angle triangle, rest is basic trig, reverse of cos,
$1/\cos(\varphi)$

```python
"%0.2f" % (1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)))
```

```text
Out[1]: '19.11'
```

The sun is roughly 19 times further than the Moon.

I dont like ragging on govs on vaccs, I know many are doing their
best. But IMO we are stuck with some sucky infra, this cant be the
setup we meet the next pandemic with.
