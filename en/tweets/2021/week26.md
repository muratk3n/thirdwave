"@sfchronicle

Californians are fueling Austin's housing frenzy: 'We've never seen
migration like this'"

But later US leaders were sufficiently beaten up about it, about AO..
HW, Kerry, McCain.. that's something.

This is chemical warfare.. 

No wonder Russkies are so into Whataboutism.. There is ample material
for it.

"During the Vietnam War, the U.S military engaged in an aggressive
program of chemical warfare codenamed Operation Ranch Hand. From 1961
to 1971, the U.S. military sprayed a range of herbicides across more
than 4.5 million acres of Vietnam to destroy the forest cover and food
crops used by enemy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops...

In addition to the massive environmental devastation of the
U.S. defoliation program in Vietnam, that nation has reported that
some 400,000 people were killed or maimed as a result of exposure to
herbicides like Agent Orange"

I guess revisions are on the way

Politico: "White House prepping big assault on monopolies"

"A US judge dismissed a blockbuster antitrust suit against Facebook
saying the case failed to "plausibly" establish that the social
network had created a monopoly - but allowed authorities the
opportunity to refile the case with revisions"

bar"

There was an assasination attempt on Hamid (pre-CUP, Otto
sultan). Makes sense, bcz Armenian killings started during
[his time](2009/09/armenians-kurds.md#hamidiya).

---

The nationalistic party of late Otto, CUP, had a key member who used
to be Jewish.

Number-two guy in the Republic (a continuation of CUP in many ways)
Ismet's father was Kurd.

How did these people end up with extreme ethnic nationalism is beyond me.

"If the three record-busting low solar price tariffs recorded in the
Middle East in the past 18 months are to be believed,
renewables-powered hydrogen in prime sites in the region could already
compete with gas-plus-CCS production, according to IRENA. Has the Gulf
discovered the new petrol?"

Whichever tech is used to generate energy doesn't matter, produce
renewable fuel, ship. H2 economy can handle all types of input.

There is [a plant](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2129691/chile-opens-vast-thermosolar-power-plant) in Chile,
they do some ultraviolet trickery, 700 hectares, 210 megawatts,

```python
hectare = 1000 # m2
"%0.2f percent efficiency" % (((210*1000*1000 / (700*hectare)) / sun_on_earth) * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '30.00 percent efficiency'
```

Ok.. not bad.. 

---

Solar panels are at 20%. They are stuck there, but comparatively
speaking CSP is much lower than panels.

---

```python
acre = 4046.86 # m2
sun_on_earth = 1000 # W/m2
"%0.2f percent efficiency" % (((1*1000*1000 / (5*acre)) / sun_on_earth) * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '4.94 percent efficiency'
```

Not good

---

"While land needs will vary by technology, a typical CSP plant requires
5 to 10 acres of land per MW of capacity"

---

Sunlight Refineries...  Or concentrating solar-powered (CSP)
installations .. They focus sunlight into one spot through mirrors,
generate heat.

What is the efficiency of the system I wonder

'Sustainable caviar'..

"Michelin-starred restaurants have been serving $300 sustainable caviar"

M98 galaxy is far away but blue shifted (coming close to us). Arent at

Because of, you know, like the Big Bang and the expanding universe? ðŸ˜¶

Salt's antibacterial abilities are overlooked.. For preserving meat
dont we add salt (as well as drying)? Salt is added not bcz it tastes
good (nat selection might have introduced that later on), we add salt
because bacteria doesn't like salt. I argue same applies for skin
care; after a good swim in the sea, don't we feel better? The skin
feels better.. The Dead Sea is the world's saltiest body of water, and
it's known to have curative effects.. There is no magic here; just
plain ol' salt.

Tug-of-war around the net-zero decision in AU? Gov coalition partner
had a leadership change. Net0 was the culprit?

"Climate change sceptic Barnaby Joyce, who was deputy prime minister
from 2016 to 2018 but resigned after an extramarital affair with a
former staffer, won a [gov coalition partner] National party
leadership vote on Monday defeating incumbent Michael McCormack...

Joyce, who will be sworn in as deputy prime minister on Tuesday, said
his party will only support an energy policy that bolsters the
government's appeal in regional Australia - which is heavily dependent
on fossil fuel mining"

The Atlantic: "Wanting to copy the happiest people in the world is an
understandable impulse, but it distracts from a key message of the
happiness rankingsâ€”that equitable, balanced societies make for happier
residents...

People are more satisfied with their lives when they have a
comfortable standard of living, a supportive social network, good
health, the latitude to choose their course in life, and a government
they trust. The highest echelon of happy countries also tends to have
universal health care, ample paid vacation time, and affordable child
care"

Every big city needs to do this. Less traffic the better. Especially
those f-ing scooters, small motorbikes (which multiplied due to
pandemic, ppl staying in and ordering packages more).

"Barcelona to expand 'superblocks' to city centre district. Introduced
in 2016, the scheme transforms nine city blocks into so-called
'â€‹superblocks', where traffic is only allowed around the perimeter"

It was tried, results aren't good. See Tom Gowers' [polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project).
PM was a designed to be a "massively collaborative mathematical project" with
the goal of solving a research problem.. Throughout it all however, it
always seemed to me Gowers was doing more work keeping the thing
together than actually enjoying its results, he was putting more work
in than he was getting out basically.. so the project is a fail. On
focused work, you need focused expert(s) of similar stature, so they can
reach a fruitful result.. Creation requires intention. Only intention
can put together the necessary pieces to generate nonlinear power. Bunch of
jagoffs "coming together" in an ad-hoc fashion will not bring about
major change.

"Can 'people power' work in detailed research"
