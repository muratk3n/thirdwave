Every big city needs to do this. Less traffic the better. Especially
those f-ing scooters, small motorbikes (which multiplied due to
pandemic, ppl staying in and ordering packages more).

"Barcelona to expand 'superblocks' to city centre district. Introduced
in 2016, the scheme transforms nine city blocks into so-called
'​superblocks', where traffic is only allowed around the perimeter"

It was tried, results aren't good. See Tom Gowers' [polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project).
PM was a designed to be a "massively collaborative mathematical project" with
the goal of solving a research problem.. Throughout it all however, it
always seemed to me Gowers was doing more work keeping the thing
together than actually enjoying its results, he was putting more work
in than he was getting out basically.. so the project is a fail. On
focused work, you need focused expert(s) of similar stature, so they can
reach a fruitful result.. Creation requires intention. Only intention
can put together the necessary pieces to generate nonlinear power. Bunch of
jagoffs "coming together" in an ad-hoc fashion will not bring about
major change.

"Can 'people power' work in detailed research"
