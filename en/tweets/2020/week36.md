Cast everything to `void *`. Then cast that anything else,

Centrist Dems and some Reps like Newt merely used the mystique of tech
to justify undoing of social services. "We cant give healthcare to
people". Why?  "Well, smart sensors, knowledge economy, blah
blah". 

3W methodology always stressed how tech, especially a different breed
of tech (post-industrial) will cause *social disruption* unless it is
handled, i.e. proper structures are formed around it. Tech by itself,
in the grander sense, will create more problems than it solves.

They didn't think of any of that. Did anyone talk about the downside?
Any related talk was cleverly steered towards hyperboly,
next-to-zero-chance type events, such as "AI apocalypse", so everyone
could slap themselves in the back and say they thought of "all
angles". "We've got that covered, you see, we are talking about the
dangers of tech". The flare having gone off, they could now go their
marry way to slut themselves to corporations.

From the song *The Unpossible*: "We have the word impossible, but we
need to differentiate between two sorts of things. The impossible is
that which by definition can never be done. We need another word:
unpossible"

As per policy I'd just insert H2 / NH4 FC tech in there somewhere. Say
"it's for long-range", "for steel". Once it is cemented for
anything, it will destroy everything else in the long-run, bcz using
the same tech for everything has other benefits, training, deployment,
maintanance etc. Alternatives will go to the way of Betamax.

---

The prevalence of the self-help lit during the 80/90s had to do with
over-commercialization of everything. Life was about "the market",
everyone working "for the market". Then, by implication, if something
bad happened to you, u felt down, it was all your fault. *You* failed
the market. Personal income disrupted for a few months and u get hit
with an health insurance bill of thousands pushing you to bankruptcy?
Your fault. You didn't have an "up personality", could not "crush
it". The guy with the big teeth will tell you how.

"The conflict between the haves and have-nots also feeds into another
major theme of cyberpunk.  Often depicting future dystopias where
megacorporations wield more power than governments, and rule the world
from lofty skyscrapers, overlooking the streets where cyberpunk heroes
try to make ends meet doing illicit jobs, either for these
corporations, or against them"

*Bladerunner* bombed when it came out? Makes sense; I never liked it
as a movie. It might have been influential on other directors, but, as
a movie on its own wasn't all that great. *Star Wars* in the 70s was
both, cinematically influential and a movie people would like.

Great idea. In fact do this every month.

JS: "One of the leading causes of homelessness in this country is, in
fact, our shortage of low-income housing. After mental illness and
substance abuse, minimum-size standards have probably kept more people
on the street than any other contributing factor. Countless attempts
to design and build efficient forms of shelter by and for the homeless
have been thwarted by these codes.  By demanding all or nothing from
our homes, current restrictions ensure that the have-nots have nothing
at all. The U.N. Declaration of Universal Human Rights (of which the
United States is a signatory) holds shelter to be a fun- damental
human right. Yet, in the U.S.. this right is guaranteed only to those
with enough money to afford the opulence"

---

Grim and grimmer

JS: "It is illegal to inhabit a tiny home in most populated areas of
the U.S. The housing industry and the banks sustaining it spent much
of the 1970s and 1980s pushing for larger houses to produce more
profit per structure, and housing authorities all cross the country
adopted this bias in the form of minimum-size standards. The stated
purpose of these codes is to preserve the high quality of living
enjoyed in our urban and suburban areas by defining how small a house
can be. They govern the size of every habitable room and details
therein. By aiming to eliminate all but the most extravagant housing,
size standards have effectively eliminated housing for everyone but
the most affluent Americans.

Again, the intention of these limits is to keep unsightly little
houses from popping up and lowering property values in America’s
communities and, moreover, to ensure that the housing industry is
adequately sustained. The actual results of the limits are a greater
number of unsightly large houses, inordinate construction waste,
higher emissions, sprawl and deforestation, and, for those who cannot
afford these larger houses, homelessness"

---

JS: "For most Americans, big houses have come to symbolize the good
life; but, all symbolism aside, the life these places actually foster
is more typically one of drudgery. Mortgage payments can appropriate
thirty to forty percent of a household’s income not counting taxes,
insurance, or maintenance expenses. When every spare penny is going
towards house payments, there is nothing left over for investments,
travel, continued education, more time with the kids, or even so much
as a minute to relax and enjoy life. At this rate, an oversized house
can start to look more like a debtor’s prison than a home"

---

JS is the grandfather of the tiny house movement.

Jay Shafer, 2009: "My reasons for choosing to live in such small
houses include some environmental concerns. The two largest of my
three, hand-built homes were made with only about 4,800 pounds of
building materials each, less than 100 pounds of which went to the
local landfill. Each produced less than 900 pounds of greenhouse gases
during a typical Iowa winter. And, at 89 square feet, plus porch and
loft, each fit snugly into a single parking space.

In contrast, the average American house consumes about three quarters
of an acre of forest and produces about seven tons of construction
waste. It emits 18 tons of greenhouse gases annually, and, at more
than 2,349 square feet, it would most definitely not fit into a single
parking space"

No I do not support DJT. Just pointing out the weirdness of how things
aligned recently... Not just in US, in UK and other places
too.. British Tory PM talking about a "New Deal" while the Labor
leader is going to extreme lengths not to seem pro-Palestine, sorry
"anti-Semitic". This is weird.

Academics can be smart but they are usually not software
engineers. They'll create bazillion of dependencies, the whole thing
becomes a mess. Also nothing easily demonstrable included (comes with
the territory, they earn their stripes being as obscure, "mystical" as
possible, the publishing process makes them so).

---

Bloody university code.

`void *`

Had not seen that for a while. 

---

Aha. So you are not supposed to say "Im was saved bcz of the right
things I *achieved*". It was a gift to you. It is emphasizing
selflessness.

Religion is ancient time's left (it is politics). Also, it is the
self-help lit of its time. Instead of a guy with big teeth running
around teaching you how to "crush it", there is the lit on how to take
it easy, chillax, turn the other cheek once in a while.

"Ephesians 2:8 

For by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves, it is the gift of God"

Motivating people to go to the voting booth falls on the shoulder of
leaders.

No

Yes

"Was Trump's 2016 election a sign of democracy working?"

---

Absolutely. One question was "you meet someone from Amsterdam, what is
their nationality?". Guy goes uuuhhh, the laughter machine goes
off... But, how cld the guy know what? Does he deal with this
particular nationality daily? Know anyone from there?

Another didn't know how rainbows work... Big deal.

Democracy doesn't need book-smart citizens. As long as they can tell
whether they are better or worse off compared to 2/4/6 yrs ago, they
can roughly judge a person, we're fine. Expecting more from them
signals to me a certain pretentiousness on the part of the expector.

Fuckin Newt

I remember Newt used to talk nonsense on tech all the time too,
'information technology will let you compare price, smart sensors blah
blah". 90s were the age of technobabble. All glitz no substance.

---

On "the war with China"; Trump doesn't like war (and not just bcz they
cost money). He had Soleimani, one guy, killed so he wouldnt have to
kill 100s or 1000s. He'll get mad at his own advisors if they get too
war-mongery around him. From a few select people he'll take it, like
Mustache, who is, as we know, not in the WH anymore.

---

It was too early for that. 3W structures were nowhere to be found, and
still MIA to this day. So what Dems ended up doing was a hi-tech
paint-job, empty talk, marketing glitz using tech while they
dismantled left using tech as excuse. This contributed to a massive
problem of inequality.

I cannot begin to describe the obnoxious daftness of these
people. That Post-Berlin-Wall euphoria must have been one hell of a
drug because they all burned their brain cells on it.

"Maybe Dems moved away from left due to new tech, as you say Third Wave"

Going against corp interests by reworking trade deals to bring labor
back which moved to China, so workers would make more money?

Yes ultra-capitalist mastermind this guy.
