Great. F the teachers (except the ones on video)

Also all online source material should be downloadable, so we also
need offline for that online. I guess in short we need digital
learning.

"@wolfejosh

CRAZY. 

Never would have guessed that demand for online learning would be
driven by a virus.

Slam...

"Judging by media coverage and the comments of party luminaries, you
might think Democrats are bitterly polarized over Bernie Sanders‚Äôs
presidential bid... Since the beginning of the year, news organization
after news organization has speculated that Sanders‚Äôs success may set
off a Democratic ‚Äúcivil war.‚Äù

But polls of Democratic voters show nothing of the sort. Among
ordinary Democrats, Sanders is strikingly popular, even with voters
who favor his rivals. He sparks less opposition‚Äîin some cases far
less‚Äîthan his major competitors. On paper, he appears well positioned
to unify the party should he win its presidential nomination.So why
all the talk of civil war? Because Sanders is far more divisive among
Democratic elites‚Äîwho prize institutional loyalty and ideological
moderation"

country was right after 9/11, stayed like that for months. Voters
don't know much.

This current world is probably a version of be-all end-all dream for
boomers. Products in markets, bunch of roads, cars, etc, especially in
2nd, 3rd world - they didn't have any of these things in such
abundance when they were young. Boy did they get what they
(uncarefully) wished for...

They are about abundance of shit.. not quality. U'd think by now would
all students would be bombarded with such great teaching material
through official channels that they'd only be limited with what they
could absorb. Didn't happen. Quite the opposite, I see majority
struggling to find content, accessing quality teaching. There is huge
indust production, still poverty. Throw away forks and knives, garbage
patch in the Pacific Ocean.

Elections are not about policy accuracy, they are about grand
messages. They are about __selling__, especially for the challenger
(not having a previous term to be judged on).

I am glad Bernie is using a label that specifically ends with the word
socialism, so the emphasis is squarely on that term. This is the best
way to draw a contrast between himself and the establishment whose
meager middle-ground centrism drove Dems to the ground. 

"Why does Bernie call himself democratic socialist when he is actually
a social democrat if we go by policies"

Buy bonds (for good yield) price goes up, yields go down. Low yields
on B-grade bonds means there is a lot of demand for that debt. B-grade
is risky, ppl are hungry.

Bubble in low grade too? ü§î

B-grade junk bond yields are way down, like __way__
[down](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#junkbond).
Peeps are hungry for yield and flooding this area too of course.

But..if we go by this graph's relation to recessions, next one does
not seem imminent.

I've had a lot of exercise on this area. Tigger nats, among their
other moronic proclaimations, also keep harping abt a "pure tigger"
whose head must be *brachycephalic* in shape (basically a round head,
like Putin's) a feature apparently of "Central Asian origin". A lot
serious people believe this shit, so ~10 yrs ago during my TR blogging
when some high ranking military types mumbled the usual nat stories, I
would just get a photo of them, [measure their
head](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/tr/2008/08/brekisefal-degil_31.html),
and look at the ratio (of height to width). It is always less than
0.85, *not brachycephalic*, then I'd say "well you do not belong to
the Turk race".  Nats start jumping up and down.. These ppl are deeply
delusional. Which describes nationalism well actually - a shared delusion.

In many ways Warren's strategy, path to nom was the hardest.. Her plan
hinged on taking progressives from Bernie (they shared a base) which
she succeeded for a while, use that momentum to gobble up centrists,
reach the goal. It all depended on Bernie not showing up, but when he
did, it was game over. Not to nag, she obviously has prog creds. But
Bernie is more of a known quantity having ran against Hillary 2016.

Douhat: "But Democrats considering this sales pitch should be very
clear on what a Bloomberg presidency would mean. Bloomberg does not
have Trump‚Äôs flagrant vices (though some of his alleged behavior with
women is pretty bad) or his bald disdain for norms and rules and legal
niceties, and so a Bloomberg presidency will feel less institutionally
threatening, less constitutionally perilous, than the ongoing wildness
of the Trump era ‚Äî in addition to delivering at least some of the
policy changes that liberals and Democrats desire.

However, feelings can be deceiving. Trump‚Äôs authoritarian tendencies
are naked on his Twitter feed, but Bloomberg‚Äôs imperial instincts, his
indifference to limits on his power, are a conspicuous feature of his
career. Trump jokes about running for a third term; Bloomberg actually
managed it, bulldozing through the necessary legal changes. Trump
tries to bully the F.B.I. and undermine civil liberties; Bloomberg ran
New York as a miniature surveillance state. Trump has cowed the
Republican Party with celebrity and bombast; Bloomberg has spent his
political career buying organizations and politicians that might
otherwise impede him. Trump blusters and bullies the press; Bloomberg
literally owns a major media organization. Trump has Putin envy;
Bloomberg hearts Xi Jinping"

Dont look to capitalists for the two-step solutions. They can only do
their thing in their little sandboxes where resources, talent, inno
are prepared for them. Bezos let that slip recently while talking abt
his space plans, that Amazon was built on an existing infrastructure
of Internet, delivery, products. His point was abt having to build
same type of infra for space so companies can innovate, but we see the
logic here...

Jobs was the same way. He would expand great effort in finding the
right component companies, for the iPhone, iPod, notebooks but that
doesn't change the fact is nearly all significant tech in today's
smartphones is tied to gov research.

Maybe Dubya did Iraq bcz he knew the allies f-d him. He was punishing
them. Why Iraq? "Doing" Iraq can only have one outcome, majority
Shites of Iraq gain power after minority leader Saddam is gone, and
neighbor (Shite) Iran's influence will increase. The mortal enemy of
the allies gets stronger.

Who protested most abt the Iraq War? SA, UAE, EG, Israel...

Who protested most abt Iran Nuke deal? Same.

Rightfully so from their POV BTW
