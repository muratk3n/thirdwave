Gold getting crushed! It’s not a safe haven play, never was. It’s a
negative real rates play until there is panic and then it gets sold
too like in 2008. The only safe haven is treasuries, which is why
advisor hacks on CNBC obsessing about its low yield always sounded
ridiculous"

Yes, it's great that NSA finally acknowledges the Section 215 call
records program was a massive waste of time & money.  But, there would
be no pressure on them to fix it if not for @Snowden. And the
pointless invasions of American's privacy is staggering"

Credit Card Delinquency Rates - Small Banks

I believe this is % of ppl missing payment for 30 days or more. If
increases, means citizens are overlevered.

```python
import pandas as pd, datetime
from pandas_datareader import data

today = datetime.datetime.now()
start=datetime.datetime(1980, 1, 1)
end=datetime.datetime(today.year, today.month, today.day)
cols = ['DRCCLOBS']
df = data.DataReader(cols, 'fred', start, end)
df.plot()
plt.axvspan('01-09-1990', '01-07-1991', color='y', alpha=0.5, lw=0)
plt.axvspan('01-03-2001', '27-10-2001', color='y', alpha=0.5, lw=0)
plt.axvspan('22-12-2007', '09-05-2009', color='y', alpha=0.5, lw=0)

Pop quiz - what is Roubini culturally? His parents are from Iran, they
were Jewish, he was born in Istanbul, he grew up in Italy, he spent
long time in US.

Because he was born in TR, I could try to claim him as one of my own,
my tigga, a homeboy.. But that would be a mistake, he didn't spend
much time there. He a Jew? Where was he at when he grew up?  In Italy,
hence the accent. That's the answer: he's a guinea. Real guinea, not
like ones in US who are Americans but try to cling to a faux identity
because of their moronic parents so they wildly gesticulate trying to
look a certain way but fail. No, this guy is a legit guinea. Problem
solved.

Hmm supply shock is inflationary, but growth slowing expectation is
deflationary. I wonder which one would win, and if the former, would
that cause treasury yields to go up? 🤔

Roubini is right - world will have a supply shock not a demand
shock. The former cannot be fixed with stimulus.
