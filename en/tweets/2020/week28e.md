"@DRxKatherine

American healthcare in a nutshell

'@DGlaucomflecken Spent 3 hours on the phone with Cigna
today. Apparently I should have been more careful about choosing
in-network doctors while I was intubated in the ICU'"

"@BCAppelbaum

Don't really care how [Biden] uses the word
[woke](https://mobile.twitter.com/seanhannity/status/1280998300397776900). Delighted
that he's outraged by noncompete agreements"

I like it... thinking like a closer.

Barkan: "[F]uture leftist presidential campaigns will need to reckon
with a traditional media apparatus that isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Noam
Chomsky is right‚Äîthe dominant mass media organizations are
profit-driven colossi that, too often, safeguard the interests of the
rich and powerful. Capitalism is their article of faith. That doesn‚Äôt
mean, however, the left can‚Äôt have a strategy for confronting this
reality and mitigating hostile coverage"

"@kartpath

I'm tired of watching our movement lose winnable races by tiny
margins. The next time a @Booker4KY, or @JCisnerosTX, or
@cristinafortx declares their candidacy, we should have their backs on
day one"

---

Tired of "apps", "web sites", or even "platforms"; the next big thing
coming out of SV should be all decentralization focused, for apps, for
e-cash, for anything

"In recent decades, corporations have taken over the internet with
proprietary networks that provide access in exchange for the loss of
privacy and ownership. The result has been an extractive data economy
that primarily serves a handful of tech giants to the detriment of
competition and innovation ‚Äî and which is ripe for an intervention.

What might it mean to reboot the internet and make it open again?
Advancements in the decentralized web such as the Internet Computer ..
can put control and ownership of networks back into the hands of the
public. ...

'Platform risk is this concept that, if you‚Äôre an entrepreneur or an
investor in startups, there is a huge existential risk that looms over
all software development, essentially, is that at some point if you‚Äôre
successful, the big guy that you‚Äôre dependent on will come and extract
rents,' remarked Dixon. 'And in some cases much worse.'

'Like in the case of Zynga,' he went on, 'Facebook just changed all
the rules. It just destroyed the economics. Twitter changed their API
that just literally killed off overnight a huge swath of startups,
like Twitter clients and things that depend on the API.'"

Beinart: "For decades I argued for separation between Israelis and
Palestinians. Now, I can imagine a Jewish home in an equal state"

"@TheBrianMcManus

The Irish covid tracking app is baller. It simply trades a code over
bluetooth to anyone you have had close contact with. When you get a
positive diagnosis you get a 6 digit code to put into the app to
notify everyone who's code you have collected. No location data needed"

---

BTW, I keep hearing words like "populists like Bolsonaro, Trump,
BJ". These are very different politicians. Bol is like an 80s Rayban
wearing Latin American dictator, still obsessed with chasing
Communists. Trump talked left, but essentially could not deliver all
of it, mixed up some other toxic stuff, it might likely crater his
party. BJ might deliver, but will Tories play along?

---

No, bitch. There is left, that's it. It is ideally delivered in a left
party, rightist most likely mix it with other things making the whole
thing combustible.

"There is left populism and there is right populism"

---

Tech infrastructure, homes.. these are good things. Hope he pulls it off.

---

And here is the "Tory PM" [announcing](https://youtu.be/0qZ_FpIEhGY?t=1173)
the British New Deal.

---

Talked abt the "original sin"; starting with fall of the Berlin Wall,
left went right, right went insane, and now, in the final phase
"outsiders" are jumping in con parties, doing leftist work in there as
the need for such approaches never went away, that some label
"populist".

---

Generally I am for (at least) two big parties covering two sides of
the spectrum. It matters.. CDU in Germany failed to "act right" during
the refugee crisis now Nazis are on the rise. There was a vacuum and
they filled it.

---

Right acting left..

"@danbloom1

Looking at Labour's Future Jobs Fund (set up in 2009, scrapped by
David Cameron) and wow people weren't kidding when they said Rishi
Sunak's new scheme is similar..."

My theory is lack of empire always helped Europe, Renaissance cld
never take place with "Holy" Roman Empire around. Later possible
empires failing helped. So EU should thank the Brits?

G. Friedman, "There were many reasons for the inability of the
Europeans to unite, but in the end it came down to a simple feature of
geography: the English Channel. First the Spanish, then the French,
and finally the Germans managed to dominate the European continent,
but none of them could cross the Channel. Because noone could defeat
Britain, conqueror after conqueror failed to hold Europe as a whole".

Also anthropology, for everyone.

---

Everyone who is pushing the boundaries, especially in physics, need to
know epistemology. What can be known, what is optimal to
know... basically knowledge about knowledge.
