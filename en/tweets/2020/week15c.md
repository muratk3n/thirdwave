"[Lessons from Italy, HBR article] 

Recognize your cognitive biases. In its early stages, the Covid-19
crisis in Italy looked nothing like a crisis. The initial
state-of-emergency declarations were met by skepticism by both the
public and many in policy circles ‚Äî even though several scientists had
been warning of the potential for a catastrophe for weeks. Indeed, in
late February some notable Italian politicians engaged in public
handshaking in Milan to make the point that the economy should not
panic and stop because of the virus. (A week later, one of these
politicians was diagnosed with Covid-19.)"

Yees bitch I did a fit on an ODE calc. Whazup?! And why not? ODE
"integrations" are like any other numerical calculation, they have
certain parameters, they are completely deterministic, so a fitting
procedure can work with that.

I did a fit on the differential eqn for the SIR model, if we use Italy
numbers, I am getting an 5.2. Different countries give different
results however. I get an 8 from China, if we believe their numbers.

U could do minwage 3.6 dollar/hour instead of 7.25 of today. That's
the amount if everyone is given 1000 dollars a month tax exempt
cash. I believe companies would be more willing to hire workers if
they have to pay less.

Also, if M4A takes the burden of this insurance fuckery off their
backs, they'd be even happier. All this stuff is GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
