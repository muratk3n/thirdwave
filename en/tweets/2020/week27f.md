"UNSW researchers report mass hydrogen storage
breakthrough. [R]esearchers led by Kondo-Francois Aguey-Zinsou say
they have developed metal alloys capable of storing surplus
electricity in the form of hydrogen much more cheaply than lithium
batteries to take advantage of the renewables rush"

There's an archaic and regressive wealth tax in America -- called the
property tax -- and guess what, its effective rate is higher for Black
and Hispanic residents"

Nice.. wonder what event he was referring to.. Russia-Persian war?

H. Marks: "Henry Kissinger was a member of [our] board when I worked
there, and a few times each year I was privileged to hear him hold
forth on world affairs. Someone would ask, 'Henry, can you explain
yesterday‚Äôs events in Bosnia?' and he‚Äôd say, 'Well, in 1722...' The
point is that chain reaction-type events can only be understood in the
context of that which went before."

"@RebuildsRich

The Tesla fanboys formed like Voltron and ganged up to flag my video
for removal on youtube. The video which was flagged for 'inappropriate
content' was about me selling my Tesla and buying a gas car
instead. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what happens when you anger the
hive"

*The Atlantic*: "As Donald Trump‚Äôs America continues to shatter records
for daily infections, France, like most other developed nations and
even some undeveloped ones, seems to have beat back the virus.The
numbers are not ambiguous. From a peak of 7,581 new cases across the
country on March 31, and with a death toll now just below 30,000‚Äîat
one point the world‚Äôs fourth highest‚Äîthere were just 526 new cases on
June 13, the day we masked ourselves and took the train back to
Paris. The caseload continues to be small and manageable. ..

America, however, is an utter disaster. Texas, Florida, and Arizona
are the newest hubs of contagion, having apparently learned nothing
from the other countries and states that previously experienced surges
in cases. I stared at my phone in disbelief when the musician Rosanne
Cash wrote on Twitter that her daughter had been called a ‚Äúliberal
pussy!‚Äù in Nashville for wearing a mask to buy groceries.That insult
succinctly conveys the crux of the problem. American leadership has
politicized the pandemic instead of trying to fight it. I see no
preparedness, no coordinated top-down leadership of the sort we‚Äôve
enjoyed in Europe"
