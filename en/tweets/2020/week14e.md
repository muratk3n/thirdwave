Of course he was right. He just couldn't sell it.

The Atlantic: "Even before the coronavirus outbreak, many on the
‚Äúpopulist,‚Äù or ‚Äúradical,‚Äù left insisted that globalization, climate
change, automation, and inequality were creating the conditions for
their own political resurgence, despite their leaders‚ÄîBernie Sanders
in the United States, Jeremy Corbyn in Britain‚Äîbeing rejected at the
ballot box. Now, in a world where governments are nationalizing wages
and public services just to keep their economies afloat, such claims
no longer seem far-fetched. Indeed, Corbyn, who will be replaced as
Labour leader today, said the emergency economic measures being taken
in Britain have proved him 'absolutely right'"

CDC: "It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social
distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.  CDC
is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to
slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus
and do not know it from transmitting it to others.  Cloth face
coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common
materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public
health measure"

Maybe it's about stakes.. I mean the stakes the writers, creators of
these shows experienced in their lives. Roddenberry was a trained
fighter pilot, even in civilian life once his plane came down in
Syrian Desert guy broke two ribs but dragged injured passengers out of
a plane and led the group to safety. His personal life was scifi,
adventure. How can the uppity, LA crackhead, cossetted, bland-life
writer compete with this?

Watched an old DS9 ep: Chief's wife gets body snatched by an alien who
wants to destroy enemy aliens in a wormhole. She has the Chief to fire
a weapon into the wormhole but the Chief figures out with the help of
Ferrengi engineer Ram turns the tables on the alien.

Wonderful ep. Why dont we have more ST shows like this anymore? The ep
was abt characters, smart, made sense, most chars were likable.

Thing is rents and mortages could be frozen as easily as other
countries have done it. But in US so much finance downstream depends
on that cash flow whose interruption could cause mayhem that they wld
rather supplement that flow rather than freeze it in any way.

This # supports the shit jobs theory.. More expandable jobs than the
smokestack industrial jobs probably. By not switching to
post-industrial we created something worse, an in-between
shitapocalypse, middle meager medium shit jobs. They are thrown away
at the first sign of trouble.

Funny (but actually sad) thing abt it is that 6,6M initial claims

The old man had it all.. I am just lip-syncing here.

Toffler, *Revolutionary Wealth*, 2006: "Because the economic
integration today is far more dense, multilayered and complicated,
linking so many diverse economies at so many different levels, it
requires systematically designed fail-safes, redundancies and other
safety devices. Unfortunately, overenthusiastic re-globalizers are
constructing a gigantic financial cruise ship lacking the watertight
compartments that even Titanic had"
