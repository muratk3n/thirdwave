"With the coronavirus pandemic and the shutdown of big parts of the
European economy, the 2x40GW Green Hydrogen Initiative can serve as a
blueprint for a bigger EU recovery, Hydrogen Europe Secretary General
Jorgo Chatzimarkakis told New Europe on April 16.

The 2x40GW Green Hydrogen Initiative aims to promote a massive
increase of electrolyser production within the EU in order to support
green hydrogen production.

Announcing the publication of the paper, Chatzimarkakis told New
Europe the 2√ó40 GW initiative can be regarded as a ‚Äúgreat asset‚Äù for
the implementation of the EU Green Deal. ‚ÄúWhat we foresee here is that
basically todays Marshall Plan would be the Green Deal"

"@BernieSanders

Instead of bailing out the health care insurance industry during this
crisis, Medicare should be required to pay all of the medical bills of
the uninsured and underinsured"

Whenever I unfollow I pick few ppl off person's follow list. I reason,
there must have been something to the person hence I started

"@davidgraeber

I've said it before, I'll say it again. Corporate bureaucracies can't
organise space exploration. Big state bureaucracies could because they
were willing to put up with weirdos"

Fabricated virus that escaped is a big possibility. A bio-attack is
another. It was the perfect weapon to hit Trump with if u think abt
it, the timing makes sense too. You see the man as the existential
threat, sacrifice some of your own to kill the enemy - isn't that how
war is conducted?  You know your dictatorial state can handle the
shutdowns, quick, but US wld have a harder time...

This is the good part

"According to [Montaigner], the altered elements of this virus are
eliminated as it spreads: 'Nature does not accept any molecular
tinkering, it will eliminate these unnatural changes and even if
nothing is done, things will get better, but unfortunately after many
deaths.' Luc Montagnier added that with the help of interfering waves,
we could eliminate these sequences and as a result stop the pandemic"

I mentioned this [early Feb](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/tweets/2020/week5.html#hivcov),
that Indian research, but there wasn't any follow-up. 

"According to Professor Luc Montagnier, winner of the Nobel Prize for
Medicine in 2008 for discovering HIV as the cause of the AIDS epidemic
together with Fran√ßoise Barr√©-Sinoussi, the SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that
was manipulated and accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan,
China, in the last quarter of 2019. According to Professor Montagnier,
this laboratory, known for its work on coronaviruses, tried to use one
of these viruses as a vector for HIV in the search for an AIDS
vaccine!

'With my colleague, bio-mathematician Jean-Claude Perez, we carefully
analyzed the description of the genome of this RNA virus,' explains
Luc Montagnier, interviewed by Dr Jean-Fran√ßois Lemoine for the daily
podcast at Pourquoi Docteur, adding that others have already explored
this avenue: Indian researchers have already tried to publish the
results of the analyses that showed that this coronavirus genome
contained sequences of another virus, ‚Ä¶ the HIV virus (AIDS virus),
but they were forced to withdraw their findings as the pressure from
the mainstream was too great"

Teacher gets 30 students on Zoom for class. Now that's a perfect waste of net bandwidth.

We are still placing tech paint on the existing system. We need to
rethink the system.

Echo State Nets - they might have value for predictable time series,
but be careful on financial time series. Fin series depends on many
other external factors other than the history of series itself. Use
real money on this, you will lose your shirt!

*Japan's Economic Dilemna*, Gao (on Japan's bubble, and following stagnation0

"The dilemma in Japanese corporate governance between, on the one hand,
strong coordination and, on the other hand, weak control and
monitoring provided the causal mechanism that led to excessive
competition, a phenomenon that was critical both to Japan‚Äôs high
growth and to the bubble. ...  ‚ÄúControl‚Äù refers to the control of
shareholders over management due to the separation between ownership
and management (Kester 1997), and ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù refers to the
mechanisms established by banks for 'assessing the credit-worthiness
of proposed projects; tracking the use of funds; distinguishing misuse
from temporary bad luck and correcting it; as well as credible
commitment to penalizing misuse as a safeguard against future misuse'...

Strong coordination was achieved, however, at the cost of deliberately
weakening shareholder control over management and weakening banks‚Äô
monitoring over corporations at the micro level (Kester 1997; Miyazaki
1963; Morozumi 1963a). Protected by the state, private corporations
and banks reduced their transaction costs through indirect financing,
through the use of the main bank system, and through business group
and reciprocal shareholding.

Sustained by the permanent employment system practiced by big
corporations and by multidimensional integration within business
groups, strong coordination led not to a socialist, planned economy
but rather to excessive competition among Japanese corporations in
investing in production capacity and technological transfers. This
excessive competition, in turn, triggered the high growth. After the
First Oil Shock, in contrast, banks‚Äô monitoring further deteriorated
as corporations began to build financial independence, separating
themselves from the main banks. In the liberalization of finance,
banks‚Äô leverage over corporations was weakened because corporations
began to raise capital through equity finance and zai‚Äôtech (financial
technology). After the Plaza Accord, moreover, the mishandling of
international demand resulted in not only an oversupply of money but
also the adoption of an expansionary fiscal policy that shifted the
incentive structure of private investments from production to the
stock and real estate markets. When the state policies served to
significantly increase investment risks, the weak control and
monitoring that characterized Japanese corporate governance
contributed directly to the rise of the bubble"
