# Week 52

"@davidsirota

Bernie getting the cold shoulder from Democrats on direct aid to
starving people and then having to find one random maverick Republican
(Hawley) to then force at least something into the bill is a parable
about the entire grotesque bipartisan political class that owns
Washington"

Even if an evil commitee planned and executed the whole thing, they
could not control any gov's response to it.

---

Sure, incumbency matters a great deal. People tend to keep the
incumbent in office unless the sky falls on their heads. But then in
2020, the sky fell on their heads 😶

---

Thailand did pretty well on corona eh?

---

So not being an overzealously pro-open-border guy did not hurt him
among Latinos. Once ppl arrive, acclimate to country, they feel more
local, do not want hoardes of new ppl coming in?

@FrancoisF24

"We've been conditioned to believe that low prices are normal prices." 

@DanaThomasParis flags the planet's addiction to cheap #jeans which
pollute & rob workers of decent wage. There's hope though w/ rise of
natural indigo and organic cotton.

Did not like *Tenet*. Tries to be cerebral but fails to entertain,
it's a bit dull too. *Total Recall* or, hey, *Inception* level mystery
is one thing, this is another.

"@CoriBush

I refuse to normalize an anti-democratic process where a few rich,
predominantly white individuals negotiate behind closed doors for most
of 2020 and give the rest of us a few hours to consider the 5,593 page
result of their secret negotiations"

After years of being stymied by well-funded interests, Congress has
agreed to ban one of the most costly and exasperating practices in
medicine: surprise medical bills"

Ramamurti sounds like a capable guy. See it is posible to be
technically knowledgable, capable and left. U dont need a former bus
driver to be President which gets you f-ing Venezuella.

"@davidsirota 

@davidckamin helped us sleuth out the Corker Kickback story.
@BharatRamamurti has been a strong voice of oversight on the CARES Act
slush fund. These are encouraging appointments"

"@AlexThomp

Biden adds @davidckamin and @BharatRamamurti to the NEC. Ramamurti is
a longtime Warren aide that the left wing has been pushing for a
position"

---

"@ella_nilsen

New Biden appointments to the National Economic Council include
@BharatRamamurti (formerly Warren's top economic adviser),
@davidckamin, and @joelle_gamble

Some context: Gamble and Ramamurti currently work with the progressive
@rooseveltinst, which broadly focuses on shifting economic power away
from corporations and towards workers by strengthening unions,
etc. And Kamin's work focuses on tax policy & combatting income
inequality"

"@davidsirota

The stimulus bill spends 166 billion for meager 600 survival checks as
America faces mass starvation and poverty. That’s less than the
estimated $200 billion increase in the net worth of Bezos, Musk &
Zuckerberg during the pandemic"

Finally got the working code, research papers, tech, all lined up for
next step.. Direction choice, lining up resources are the hardest
part.  Wasting time bad.. every move needs to count.

[This](.././2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.md#australia) is why Oz is
friendly with a naval power, first Britain, than US. They get naval
help, but then have to provide military assist to it.

Then, if someone is hitting at the help, is hitting at that
relationship, see the China-Oz row over the artificial Afganistan
photo.

Otto loss during WWI? Also [inevitable](../../2015/03/gallipoli.md). There
was a not-bad show of defense, at Gallipoli for instance, but failed
to change the final outcome.

---

Germany - Otto alliance during WWI? An act of
[desparation](../../2020/08/germany-otto-alliance.md), not triggered by
"ideology changes" on the part of Otto. 

---

Time to dissect.. like dissecting, seeing how all parts work

---

Force of habit from biz programming days.. keeping dependencies as
minimal as possible. Even my most demo-ready number crunching code
wont depend on UI, it will dump select shots during simulation as png.
Then I'll show the ImageMagick to piece the GIF together from those
pics. Short, to the point, less depend.

Man getting that VNC to work was tough business

Ok..Ok.. We'll do Eulerian style too 🙄

Looking at the religious [make-up](2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.md#religion)
of the area is demonstrative.

Migrant quickly assimilates in a gen, so bunch of ragged punks from
"Central Asia" certainly did not create culture in today's
Anatolia. They were assimilated. Gone. Forget these fairy tales of
wolves, some f-ing mountain, with a crack through it or whatever fuck,
these tiggers are no different from any culture that came and went
before them. The fairy tales are escapism.

"@billy_penn

PA never spent $108 million of 175 million in CARES Act funding meant
for rent and mortgage relief. The money will now go to the Dept of
Corrections instead.

'Pa. misses deadline to spend $108M in rent, mortgage relief from CARES Act'"

People who grow up in a place, from a very young age, get its culture
codes automagically by osmosis (embedded in the second-level emotional
brain), so they are citizens, no matter their ethnic, cultural
origin. Origin, assumed subculture, parental 'heritage' matters
little.

People might try to posture, "represent" around origin, perhaps as a
reaction to being called a certain label all their lives, but both
sides of that argument is wrong. 2 wrongs dont make 1 right.

Hidalgo's analysis teases out the presence of these networks through
'product palette complexity' in the data, which highly correlate with
GDP (higher than ed level). The better your network, more complex your
products, the higher your GDP.

---

Why does success story belong to host country for even late
immigrating scientists? Power of expertise networks. Working side by
side is an effective knowledge xfer channel, that's why inno likes
such pockets ... See [Hidalgo](../../2017/08/production-gdp-globalization.md).
U go to expt network, u benefit from it, inno flows from it. Those
pockets, its country, get the credit.

I for one will be happy this aspect of the show to be over, WH being
visibly divided on key issues. It always smacked off incompetence,
talking abt the head now, tactical moves of a flailing inexperienced

A docu I saw made it sound Afghanistan was a nuisance, a problem
Gorbachev was sort of stuck with.. But actually Gorbacev was adamantly
against that war, from the beginning.

he came to power]"
