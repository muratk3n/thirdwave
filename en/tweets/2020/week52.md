PA never spent $108 million of 175 million in CARES Act funding meant
for rent and mortgage relief. The money will now go to the Dept of
Corrections instead.

People who grow up in a place, from a very young age, get its culture
codes automagically by osmosis (embedded in the second-level emotional
brain), so they are citizens, no matter their ethnic, cultural
origin. Origin, assumed subculture, parental 'heritage' matters
little.

People might try to posture, "represent" around origin, perhaps as a
reaction to being called a certain label all their lives, but both
sides of that argument is wrong. 2 wrongs dont make 1 right.

Hidalgo's analysis teases out the presence of these networks through
'product palette complexity' in the data, which highly correlate with
GDP (higher than ed level). The better your network, more complex your
products, the higher your GDP.

Why does success story belong to host country for even late
immigrating scientists? Power of expertise networks. Working side by
side is an effective knowledge xfer channel, that's why inno likes
such pockets ... See [Hidalgo](2017/08/production-gdp-globalization.md).
U go to expt network, u benefit from it, inno flows from it. Those
pockets, its country, get the credit.

I for one will be happy this aspect of the show to be over, WH being
visibly divided on key issues. It always smacked off incompetence,
talking abt the head now, tactical moves of a flailing inexperienced
STP.

Dreampolitik. I like the word.

Douhat: "This postelection division of the Republican Party extends and deepens
an important trend in American politics: The cultivation of a kind of
‚Äúdreampolitik‚Äù (to steal a word from Joan Didion), a politics of
partisan fantasy"

A docu I saw made it sound Afghanistan was a nuisance, a problem
Gorbachev was sort of stuck with.. But actually Gorbacev was adamantly
against that war, from the beginning.

"The [Soviet] war in Afghanistan was a thorn in Gorbacev's side [after
he came to power]"

This dev board is fantastic. I am looking at an insanely realistic
