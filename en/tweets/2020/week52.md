"Calling it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Goldman Sachs estimates
the addressable market [of H2] could be worth ‚Ç¨10 trillion ($11.7
trillion) by 2050, split between Asia, the U.S. and Europe"

---

"[I]t looks like the future [with H2] has arrived as seven of the
biggest green hydrogen project developers come together to launch the
Green Hydrogen Catapult Initiative in a bid to increase the production
of green hydrogen 50-fold in the next six years"

"@davidsirota

The stimulus bill spends 166 billion for meager 600 survival checks as
America faces mass starvation and poverty. That‚Äôs less than the
estimated $200 billion increase in the net worth of Bezos, Musk &
Zuckerberg during the pandemic"

Finally got the working code, research papers, tech, all lined up for
next step.. Direction choice, lining up resources are the hardest
part.  Wasting time bad.. every move needs to count.

[This](2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.md#australia) is why Oz is
friendly with a naval power, first Britain, than US. They get naval
help, but then have to provide military assist to it.

Then, if someone is hitting at the help, is hitting at that
relationship, see the China-Oz row over the artificial Afganistan
photo.

Otto loss during WWI? Also [inevitable](2015/03/gallipoli.md). There
was a not-bad show of defense, at Gallipoli for instance, but failed
to change the final outcome.

---

Germany - Otto alliance during WWI? An act of
[desparation](2020/08/germany-otto-alliance.md), not triggered by
"ideology changes" on the part of Otto. 

---

Time to dissect.. like dissecting, seeing how all parts work

---

Force of habit from biz programming days.. keeping dependencies as
minimal as possible. Even my most demo-ready number crunching code
wont depend on UI, it will dump select shots during simulation as png.
Then I'll show the ImageMagick to piece the GIF together from those
pics. Short, to the point, less depend.

Man getting that VNC to work was tough business

Ok..Ok.. We'll do Eulerian style too üôÑ

Looking at the religious [make-up](2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.md#religion)
of the area is demonstrative.

---

Migrant quickly assimilates in a gen, so bunch of ragged punks from
"Central Asia" certainly did not create culture in today's
Anatolia. They were assimilated. Gone. Forget these fairy tales of
wolves, some f-ing mountain, with a crack through it or whatever fuck,
these tiggers are no different from any culture that came and went
before them. The fairy tales are escapism.

"@billy_penn

PA never spent $108 million of 175 million in CARES Act funding meant
for rent and mortgage relief. The money will now go to the Dept of
Corrections instead.

'Pa. misses deadline to spend $108M in rent, mortgage relief from CARES Act'"

People who grow up in a place, from a very young age, get its culture
codes automagically by osmosis (embedded in the second-level emotional
brain), so they are citizens, no matter their ethnic, cultural
origin. Origin, assumed subculture, parental 'heritage' matters
little.

People might try to posture, "represent" around origin, perhaps as a
reaction to being called a certain label all their lives, but both
sides of that argument is wrong. 2 wrongs dont make 1 right.

Hidalgo's analysis teases out the presence of these networks through
'product palette complexity' in the data, which highly correlate with
GDP (higher than ed level). The better your network, more complex your
products, the higher your GDP.

---

Why does success story belong to host country for even late
immigrating scientists? Power of expertise networks. Working side by
side is an effective knowledge xfer channel, that's why inno likes
such pockets ... See [Hidalgo](2017/08/production-gdp-globalization.md).
U go to expt network, u benefit from it, inno flows from it. Those
pockets, its country, get the credit.

I for one will be happy this aspect of the show to be over, WH being
visibly divided on key issues. It always smacked off incompetence,
talking abt the head now, tactical moves of a flailing inexperienced
STP.

Dreampolitik. I like the word.

Douhat: "This postelection division of the Republican Party extends and deepens
an important trend in American politics: The cultivation of a kind of
‚Äúdreampolitik‚Äù (to steal a word from Joan Didion), a politics of
partisan fantasy"

A docu I saw made it sound Afghanistan was a nuisance, a problem
Gorbachev was sort of stuck with.. But actually Gorbacev was adamantly
against that war, from the beginning.

"The [Soviet] war in Afghanistan was a thorn in Gorbacev's side [after
he came to power]"

This dev board is fantastic. I am looking at an insanely realistic
