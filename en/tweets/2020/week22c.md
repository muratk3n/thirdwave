U know he was personally running that shit.

Haha.. I like it how he compared current healthcare system to slavery.

Somebody said the other day, 'You don't have to change the whole
healthcare system in the middle of a pandemic!' But we changed slavery

"Congressman Richard Neal, who represents the state‚Äôs 1st district, has
time and time again blocked popular progressive priorities as the
Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. ...

This year, he finally faces a real primary challenge from a dynamic
progressive  ...

'Even in the middle of this pandemic here in Holyoke, in this
district, when you look at outcomes, you would never know we have one
of the most powerful members of Congress representing us,' [challenger
Alex Morse] says. 'In the middle of this pandemic, our community
hospital here in Holyoke isn't qualifying for substantial benefit or
aid from the CARES Act'"

This couldn't not happen... Some of the smartest people are in
physics, they had to notice they were stuck in the mud and going
nowhere with string theory. I dont care how many 'eminent' types they
pulled over their side, how much of a religion it became, eventually
reality had to set in.

Now that I think abt it, the Libyan mess is also Obama's 1st term.

Likely pattern in the GINI (inequality) plot..? GINI starts getting
worse, starting from the beginning of second Clinton term, until the
end of 1st Bam term. It's almost a straight line from Clinton to
Obama.  What went wrong in that 2nd Clinton term? W was a mess sure,
but degredation continued throghout Bama's 1st term.

What were the changes for his 2nd term?  I know a lot of Clinton types
were gone by then, including "the Clinton" herself, Summers, f-ing
Rahm ü§î. Is there causality here, or just "W tax cuts expiring" as some
comments suggest.

The skinny on Lebanon among IR types is this; every religious, ethnic
group is represented there. So whenever there is conflict between
those groups on the outside, there is conflict among the same groups
on the inside. IOW the situtation in Lebanon is fragile, the setup is
ready to blow, bcz of those groups. Who, which, when; that's like
trying to guess which water molecule will crystallize first in water
when temparature is lowered. Some see that event as a surprise,
"tipping point", an unexpected event; the truth of the matter is temp
is low, and at some point, no matter which part of the water
crystallizes first, the whole thing will turn to ice.

"Noone could have predicted the Lebanon Civil War"

Like I was saying..

"In the mid to late nineteenth century the Ottoman intellectual and
political elite adopted romantic nationalist ideas that equated
Ottomanism with Turkishness. This trend contributed to the alienation
of the non-Turkish subjects of Istanbul, most of them Arabs, from the
Ottoman Empire"

Riight.. "When we arrived there was noone here". Sounds familiar..
(in tigger case even the arrival itself that had lasting effect is a
hoax, "the outsiders" are deluded insiders -but anyway-).

"Palestine was an empty land [when Jews 'came back']. In this story,
by 1800 Palestine had become a desert, where farmers who did not
belong there somehow cultivated parched land that was not theirs. The
same land appeared to be an island, with a significant Jewish
population .. . Every passing year the land became more barren,
deforestation increased, and farmland turned to desert. Promoted
through an official state website this fabricated picture is
unprecedented. ..  Quite a few [researchers], such as David Grossman
(the demographer not the famous author), Amnon Cohen, and Yehoushua
Ben-Arieh, have indeed successfully challenged it. Their research
shows that, over the centuries, Palestine, rather than being a desert,
was a thriving Arab society‚Äîmostly Muslim, predominantly rural, but
with vibrant urban centers"
