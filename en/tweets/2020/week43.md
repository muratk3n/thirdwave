UK drove 303.7 billion miles in 2013. Let's say all their cars were
bitch BEVs. Take miles driven in half a day and assume energ for that
is stored in bat, with range 250 miles per 75 kwh bat, and 60kg of
lithium per 70kWh,

```python
mday = 303e9 / (365.*2)
print ("%d tons" % (mday / 250 * 60 / 1e3))
```

```text
99616 tons
```

Only UK wld require 1/10th of a million ton of lithium. This is for
one country just to drive. World reserves are a mere 17 million tons.

Bill David on ammonia.

"[04:24] Because in 1908 and 1910, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch managed
to produce ammonia.  And they used nitrogen from air, and they used
hydrogen from water 100 years ago to do that.  And nowadays, we have
170 million tons of ammonia produced each year.  And it's principally
used for fertilizers.  And the statistic is that about half of the
world would go hungry if we didn't have ammonia, if we didn't have
artificial fertilizers"

"[04:52] 40% of the nitrogen that sits in your bodies, that sits in my
body, has actually made its way through the Haber-Bosch process"

"[05:31] But I guess very few of you will know this next piece of
history.  Because this is 1943.  And this, to me, is an absolutely
magnificent story.  It's the middle of World War II.  The Belgians
have actually run out of diesel.  It's been appropriated for war
purposes.  And their bus fleet grinds to a halt.  This is in November, 1942.
In May, 1943, the bus fleet was up and running with a mixture
of ammonia and hydrogen, running the bus fleet tens of thousands of
kilometers accident-free in the middle of World War II"

"[07:03] [W]e've managed to take a combination of sodium and sodium
amide.  And that's actually basically cracking the ammonia,
decomposing that ammonia, as well as the best ruthenium catalysts"

"[7:30] In a reactor not much bigger than AA bat, we got 30 Watts power
out of it, enough to power a television"

"[13:46] But I want to say that there's actually
a bigger level, a bigger moonshot that we can aim at.
Because ammonia already provides food for half the planet.
When you combust ammonia, when you use ammonia
in a fuel cell, what comes out at the end is water.

So we've got food.

We've got water.

I've talked about energy.  And in fact, what ammonia can do is it can
contribute to a bigger issue, a bigger dream of contributing to the
food, water, energy nexus"

Plug is forecasting sales of 1.2 billion dollars and an operating
profit of $200 million after the \#acquisition of United \#Hydrogen
Group Inc. and Giner ELX.  Over 50% of the \#hydrogen it uses will be
green by 2024 according to its goal.  \#HydrogenNow @HydrogenFC

Cool to be in the future! (Or even in today's fi).

According to *Einstein's Unfinished Revolution*, Smolin doesn't like
BM bcz "pilot wave theory fails to satisfy another of our principles:
Einstein’s principle of reciprocity. The pilot wave guides the
particle, but the particle has no effect back on the wave".

"Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation announced that it has
signed an agreement with New Energy and the Industrial Technology
Development Organization (NEDO) for a multi-utility pure hydrogen fuel
cell module for large modes of transport. As a part of technology R&D
programs for widespread implementation of fuel cells, this project
will develop a compact, lightweight, and high-power 200kW class
standard module of a pure hydrogen fuel cell"

Not surprising, Italian fascists built the social security system of
the country.

There is no "left populism", or "right populism". A grab bag of issues
stolen from right and left held together by media trickery or
authoritarinism does not deserve its own lexicon. Most of the time it
is simply fascism-lite. That's it.

"In many West European countries, traditional right wing parties are
challenged by a ‘populist right wing’ discourse which also started to
argue for redistributive welfare policies"

It's about $2NH_3 + 3/2 O_2 \to 3 H_2 O + N_2$

not about $CH_4 += 2O_2 \to 2H_2 O + CO_2$,
