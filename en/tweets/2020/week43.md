According to [EIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) ,
estimated world energy consumption was 157,481 Terrawatt Hours in 2013.

```python
consumed = (157481. / (365*2)) * 1e9 # Kwh
print ("%d mil. tons" % (consumed / 70.0 * 60.0 / 1e9))
```

```text
184 mil. tons
```

Storing today's energy consumption for half a day requires over ten
times the amount of available lithium in the world.

Unfortunately for its rabid following this route is dead. The tech has
no future. Hell, it didn't even have a present based on these numbers.

---

Exactly. And we should be ready for that. Plus that 10 KW number
itself will grow, for everyone.

Leaving that aside, even today's energy requirements are out of reach
for bats

"You said lith mines aren't enough.. But [10 KW per
person](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2020/07/h2-numbers.html#lithium)
energy consumption is based on everyone consuming in US standards"

People making movies don't necessarily understand what they are
making, in the analytical sense. Art connects at many levels, one of
them is emotion, which is below analytical mind. Then movie makers
connecting to that in the audience also go through their own
subconcious. George Lucas thought he was making a movie with
allegories to Nazi Germany, Vietnam, Nixon, but he ended up making a
movie about early Christians and Rome in *Star Wars*. TV show *Lost*
looked like an existential drama, pondering the afterlife, or abt
nothing at all with random people running around through a
confusion-made-cool wizardry, but the show is actually about our
hunter-gatherer experience, and ills of modernity.

Chris Hedges: "The Democrats and their liberal apologists adopt
tolerant positions on issues regarding race, religion, immigration,
women's rights and sexual identity and pretend this is politics. But
these issues are societal or ethical issues; they are important, but
they are not social or political issues. The seizure of control of the
economy by a class of global speculators and corporations has ruined
the lives of the very groups the democrats pretend to lift up. When
Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party for example destroyed the old
welfare system 70% of the recipients were children. Those on the right
of the political spectrum, and we must never forget that the positions
of the Democratic party would make it a far right party in Europe,
demonize those on the margins of society as scapegoats. The culture
wars mask the reality both parties are full partners in the
destruction of our democratic institutions, both parties have
reconfigured American society into a mafia state"

UK drove 303.7 billion miles in 2013. Let's say all their cars were
bitch BEVs. Take miles driven in half a day and assume energ for that
is stored in bat, with range 250 miles per 75 kwh bat, and 60kg of
lithium per 70kWh,

```python
mday = 303e9 / (365.*2)
print ("%d tons" % (mday / 250 * 60 / 1e3))
```

```text
99616 tons
```

Only UK wld require 1/10th of a million ton of lithium. This is for
one country just to drive. World reserves are a mere 17 million tons.

Bill David on ammonia.

"[04:24] Because in 1908 and 1910, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch managed
to produce ammonia.  And they used nitrogen from air, and they used
hydrogen from water 100 years ago to do that.  And nowadays, we have
170 million tons of ammonia produced each year.  And it's principally
used for fertilizers.  And the statistic is that about half of the
world would go hungry if we didn't have ammonia, if we didn't have
artificial fertilizers"

"[04:52] 40% of the nitrogen that sits in your bodies, that sits in my
body, has actually made its way through the Haber-Bosch process"

"[05:31] But I guess very few of you will know this next piece of
history.  Because this is 1943.  And this, to me, is an absolutely
magnificent story.  It's the middle of World War II.  The Belgians
have actually run out of diesel.  It's been appropriated for war
purposes.  And their bus fleet grinds to a halt.  This is in November, 1942.
In May, 1943, the bus fleet was up and running with a mixture
of ammonia and hydrogen, running the bus fleet tens of thousands of
kilometers accident-free in the middle of World War II"

"[07:03] [W]e've managed to take a combination of sodium and sodium
amide.  And that's actually basically cracking the ammonia,
decomposing that ammonia, as well as the best ruthenium catalysts"

"[7:30] In a reactor not much bigger than AA bat, we got 30 Watts power
out of it, enough to power a television"

"[13:46] But I want to say that there's actually
a bigger level, a bigger moonshot that we can aim at.
Because ammonia already provides food for half the planet.
When you combust ammonia, when you use ammonia
in a fuel cell, what comes out at the end is water.

So we've got food.

We've got water.

I've talked about energy.  And in fact, what ammonia can do is it can
contribute to a bigger issue, a bigger dream of contributing to the
food, water, energy nexus"

Not surprising, Italian fascists built the social security system of
the country.

There is no "left populism", or "right populism". A grab bag of issues
stolen from right and left held together by media trickery or
authoritarinism does not deserve its own lexicon. Most of the time it
is simply fascism-lite. That's it.

"In many West European countries, traditional right wing parties are
challenged by a ‘populist right wing’ discourse which also started to
argue for redistributive welfare policies"
