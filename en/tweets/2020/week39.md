Did new cases jump in UK? Compared to DE,

```
Country/Region  Germany +  Germany %    UK +      UK %
9/16/20            1855.0   0.585869  4007.0  0.858203
9/17/20            2179.0   0.592121  3410.0  0.863345
9/18/20            2199.0   0.621374  4329.0  0.905661

"@davidsirota

Sorta feel like our future is Tatooine — it’s hot and dry and all the
gadgets are super cool but decaying and dusty and the place is run by
local gangsters with a national government that is just a stormtrooper
militia but provides no public services"

Americans are being treated like Mexicans.. Soon there will be a wall
btw US and Canada.

"@BillBlair

We are extending non-essential travel restrictions with the United
States until October 21st, 2020. We will continue to base our
decisions on the best public health advice available to keep Canadians
safe"

"I thought about [climate] a lot last week, as I tried to stop my
toddler from playing in ash, tried to calm down my dogs as they paced
and panted in mid-morning dusk light, tried to figure out whether my
air purifier was actually protecting my lungs, tried to understand why
the sky was pumpkin-colored, and tried not to think about the
carcinogen risk of breathing in wildfire smoke, week after week.The
government has committed to defending us and our allies against
foreign enemies. Yet when it comes to the single biggest existential
threat we collectively face—the one that threatens to make much of the
planet uninhabitable, starve millions, and incite violent conflicts
around the world—it has chosen to do near-nothing. Worse than that,
the federal government continues to subsidize and promote fossil
fuels"

K-shaped recovery? :) So with this one econ splits in to two, recovery
for the rich, continuing crisis for the rest (kinda like post 2008?)

Electorate not caring abt econ is possible, in Serbia in the first
election post covid the incumbent did well.

---

Aha. Markovitz (the inventor of the model I use for election
prediction) says electorate *will* understand the economic
contraction. He has a new pandemic model, drops all parameters except
one, net popularity.

His new regression shows DJT loses even at net popul 0%, currently at
-%9.

"There are good reasons to expect that two of these predictors — the
change in real GDP in the second quarter and the time for change dummy
variable — will not perform as they normally do in 2020. Although the
U.S. economy is currently experiencing a severe downturn, with real
GDP plunging by an almost unprecedented amount in the second quarter,
voters do not appear to hold the incumbent president responsible for
this. That is undoubtedly because the recession was deliberately
induced in order to try to control the spread of the deadly
coronavirus"
