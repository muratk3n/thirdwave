"@MrAndrew

Out running this morning on a new route and a lady runs past
me. Despite only passing, when I get home @Strava automatically tags
her in my run. If I click on her face it shows her full name, picture
and a map of her running route (which effectively shows where she
lives)

This is despite the fact that I don't follow her and she doesn't share
her activity publicly. So basically if someone sees a woman running
alone there's an app they can go to see her name, picture and address"

What a bleeping effin nonsense this Brexit.. People were misled by
those who were supposed to represent them. End it and get rid of those

"Carbon emissions of richest 1 percent more than double the emissions
of the poorest half of humanity...

Annual emissions grew by 60 percent between 1990 and 2015. The richest
5 percent were responsible for over a third (37 percent) of this
growth. The total increase in emissions of the richest one percent was
three times more than that of the poorest 50 percent"

"Jesus Christ was a socialist activist" -- exactly.

Hudson: "The Christianity we know today is not the Christianity of
Jesus.. Indeed the Judaism that we know today is not the Judaism of
Jesus either. Lord’s Prayer, ‘forgive us our sins even as we forgive
all who are indebted to us’, refers specifically to debt.

Most religious leaders say that Christianity is all about sin, not
debt. But actually, the word for sin and debt is the same in almost
every language.

‘Schuld’, in German, means ‘debt’ as well as ‘offense’ or, ‘sin’. It’s
‘devoir’ in French. It had the same duality in meaning in the
Babylonian language of Akkadian.”

The idea harks back to the concept of ‘wergeld’, which existed in
parts of Europe and Babylonia, and set the value of a human life based
on their rank, paid as compensation to the family of someone who has
been injured or killed. he payment – the Schuld or obligation –
expiates you of the injury caused by the offense

People tend to think of the Commandment ‘do not covet your neighbour’s
wife’ in purely sexual terms but actually, the economist says it
refers specifically to creditors who would force the wives and
daughters of debtors into sex slavery as collateral for unpaid debt.

Similarly, the Commandment ‘thou shalt not steal’ refers to usury and
exploitation by threat for debts owing.

Jesus was crucified for his views on debt. Crucifixion being a
punishment reserved especially for political dissidents.

To understand the crucifixion of Jesus is to understand it was his
punishment for his economic views. He was a threat to the creditors.

Jesus Christ was a socialist activist for the continuity of regular
debt jubilees that were considered essential to the wellbeing of
ancient economies

Governments can forgive debt. The bible says so"

"Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ: BLDP; TSX: BLDP) today announced the
launch of the fuel cell industry’s first module designed for primary
propulsion power in marine vessels. Ballard’s FCwave fuel cell
product is a 200-kilowatt (kW) modular unit that can be scaled in
series up to the multi-megawatt (MW) power level.

The FCwave product provides primary propulsion power for marine
vessels – such as passenger and car ferries, river push boats, and
fishing boats – as well as stationary electrical power to support
hotel and auxiliary loads on cruise ships and other vessels while
docked at port (also known as ‘cold ironing’)"

Another proof that we are not teaching science, but cargo cult
science.  There are still flat-earthers. We've known Earth is not flat
for over two millenia. Yet the so-called "educated" would be hard
pressed to prove this fact starting from simple assumptions, hence
they cannot prove it to others with conviction, disinformation
grows. We created a culture of technobabble with little true knowledge.

I wonder how much predictive power the neighboring quakes have for
predicting a quake in a particular location 🤔

---

Earthquake data from an API,

```python
from quakefeeds import QuakeFeed
feed = QuakeFeed("4.5", "day")
print (len(feed))
print (feed.event_title(0))
print (feed.event_title(1))
print (feed.event_title(2))
```

```text
8
M 4.5 - 14 km N of Tisco, Peru
M 5.0 - 6 km NNE of Falam, Myanmar
M 4.5 - 248 km N of Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands
```

8 quakes >=4.5 in a day, all around the world.

"I thought about [climate] a lot last week, as I tried to stop my
toddler from playing in ash, tried to calm down my dogs as they paced
and panted in mid-morning dusk light, tried to figure out whether my
air purifier was actually protecting my lungs, tried to understand why
the sky was pumpkin-colored, and tried not to think about the
carcinogen risk of breathing in wildfire smoke, week after week.The
government has committed to defending us and our allies against
foreign enemies. Yet when it comes to the single biggest existential
threat we collectively face—the one that threatens to make much of the
planet uninhabitable, starve millions, and incite violent conflicts
around the world—it has chosen to do near-nothing. Worse than that,
the federal government continues to subsidize and promote fossil
fuels"

Electorate not caring abt econ is possible, in Serbia in the first
election post covid the incumbent did well.

---

Aha. Markovitz (the inventor of the model I use for election
prediction) says electorate *will* understand the economic
contraction. He has a new pandemic model, drops all parameters except
one, net popularity.

His new regression shows DJT loses even at net popul 0%, currently at
-%9.

"There are good reasons to expect that two of these predictors — the
change in real GDP in the second quarter and the time for change dummy
variable — will not perform as they normally do in 2020. Although the
U.S. economy is currently experiencing a severe downturn, with real
GDP plunging by an almost unprecedented amount in the second quarter,
voters do not appear to hold the incumbent president responsible for
this. That is undoubtedly because the recession was deliberately
induced in order to try to control the spread of the deadly
coronavirus"
