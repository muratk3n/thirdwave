"@stevemorris__

"@davidsirota

Huge kudos to @BernieSanders for getting the Congressional Budget
Office to publish this report on tax cheating, and how it relates to
cuts to the IRS enforcement budget"

The last of my blogspot blog hits the dust all in markdown. There is
no 'add post' button. There is no 'publish' button. Just files, and
`git push`.

Just watched *The Outpost* (based on a true story). They made it sound
like USG built the outpost in an indefensible position by mistake. Cld
be intentional. The place was a like a honey pot, pulling Tali
fighters in. At a bad night mil lost what, 7 ppl?, other side close to
hundred.

Australian CSIRO had tech for a while now to "crack ammonia" basically
converting it on site to take hydrogen out. H2 fuel stations can take
ammonia, and serve H2 right there for their HFC car customers.

Ammonia! Good choice.

"The completed facility will produce 650 tons of green hydrogen daily,
enough to run around 20,000 hydrogen-fueled buses, Air Products
said. The fuel will be shipped as ammonia to end markets globally then
converted back to hydrogen. Ammonia production is expected to start in
2025"
