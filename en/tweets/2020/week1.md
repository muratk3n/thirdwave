Hyundai Nexo HFC car emits drinkable water from its exhaust (instead
of carbon monoxide, isn't that cool?) so maybe that's the way to get
desalinated water. Seawater -> H2 -> HFC -> Water. Then u'd have to
use H2 for something but that's easy, that's why we'd have H2 fuel in
the first place. Heating, electricity generation, etc. will not only
do work, it will also create water.

Have to. Really? Especially when the connection btw work and outcome

I think subconciously they are feeling the creakiness of the current

institutions built around older tech would make least sense to them.

"Explanations like Tim‚Äôs are at the core of the millennial reputation
... failures at what‚Äôs come to be known as 'adulting,' a word invented
by millennials as a catchall for the tasks of self-sufficient
existence. Expressions of 'adulting' do often come off as privileged

"A Global Green New Deal

Right before Christmas, researchers from Stanford and Berkley,
published a 119-page report ..

The plan would require an investment of about $73T USD over the next
30 years, but the research shows that a payback period, adjusted for
new jobs and estimated savings from climate related disasters, could
be as little as 7 years...

The best thing about this plan, almost all of the technology needed to
make it happen already exists...

The net job creation from this plan would be 28.6M"

"A little-noticed 2018 methane leak at an Exxon Mobil site in Ohio was
one of the worst in recent memory, outpacing the methane emissions
from the entire oil and gas industries of many countries.

That's according to a paper published Dec. 16 .. When the natural gas
well in Belmont County, Ohio, blew in February, it was a significant
local event, prompting the evacuation of about 100 residents within a
1-mile (1.6 kilometers) radius, the Times reported. But it wasn't
clear how large the leak was until researchers in the new paper,
studying data from a new European Space Agency (ESA)
methane-monitoring satellite, spotted the plume."

I dont think everyone understands the significance of decelaration in
economic numbers. Deceleration means someone slammed on the
brakes. You might see increases on certain numbers afterwards, but
their increase rate is slowing. The car is still gaining distance but
it is gaining that distance less and less (until full stop). Because
decel is keyed to that slamming the brakes event it is a signifier of
things to come.

"Despite subsidies of about $10,000 per car, battery-powered electric
cars represent less than one-third of 1% of the world‚Äôs 1 billion
vehicles. The IEA estimates that with sustained political pressure and
subsidies, electric cars could account for 15% of the much larger

We already spend $129 billion per year subsidizing solar and wind

"Titan is one of the many satellites in the outer solar system with an
interior water ocean, making it an ideal place to search for elements
necessary for the origin of life. It's much colder than our planet,
but is chemically similar to early Earth, Turtle said.

<img width="340" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/12/dragonfly1-768x432.jpg"/>

Humans have probed Titan in the past. In 2005, the European Space
Agency landed on the moon during the Cassini mission, parachuting a
camera toward the terrain that took photos during its
two-and-a-half-hour descent. With Dragonfly, scientists hope to
measure the chemical composition of the moon's surface. They'll look
at how Titan's atmosphere could affect those chemical compounds to get
a better picture of which might be biologically relevant to the
development of life"
