"AFC's hydrogen fuel cells will have a low cost per kilowatt hour
(kWh) compared to alternative generating systems ...  Trials have
shown that AFC's proprietary fuel cell system can use "off the shelf"
ammonia cracking technology, with little difference in performance
compared to hydrogen sourced from industrial plants"

It's true. I couldnt believe so many "accomplished" types acted like
f--ing imbeciles. Truly shocked.

If you go with that, Stallone is Jewish.

"But isn't a quarter, or a half enough?"

Haha. He comes across 100% culturally American of course, I mean the
actor himself.. which is also true for most [minorities in
US](../../2019/11/faux-ambassadors.md). He acts a certain streotype
well though.. the take is somewhat comical most likely based on
impressions he gleaned growing up among real Italians, u know, the
ones *truly* off the boat.

"@KFILE

Robert De Niro is only a quarter Italian"

How much money can Anatolians generate from H2? Based on [H2 numbers](../../2020/07/h2-numbers.md),

Panels can produce 1000 W/$m^2$. 

The green area seen on the map is 100 km x 100 km

<img width="340" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcO9kb1X0AAzdEp?format=png&name=small"/>

1 kg H2 requires 50–55 kW⋅h

In Europe gasoline is 3.51 dollar/kg, let's say H2 is sold at 4
dollar/kg by mass producers. As a conservative estimate, I give 50%
efficiency to the entire process.

```python
eff = 0.50
area = 100*100 * 1e6
energy = 24 * 1000 * area * eff / 1e3 # kWh
h2mass = energy / 55.0
print (np.round(h2mass * 4 / 1e9), 'Billion USD / day')
```

```text
9.0 Billion USD / day
```

That green area can generate 9 billion dollars of revenue per day.

Do a tenth of the area, increase efficiency a little, you get 1 Bil
USD / day, >300 Bil annually, more than a third of the country's GDP.

It’s sort of striking how little actual reforming of policing has

"@KwCongressional

Beyoncé is not even African American. She is faking this for
exposure. Her real name is Ann Marie Lastrassi. She is Italian. This
is all part of the Soros Deep State agenda for the Black Lives Matter
