What does Spanish Flu levels death mean? It is said most ppl actively
have 200 ppl in their immediate network. 10 of them will die.

"We dont know the real divisor of the virus infected to calculate the
real death rate". OK.. let's play. Let's say the 20% kill rate is
among the symptomatic. Then how do we get the the ratio of ppl who 1)
get infected in the entire population 2) if they are infected, become
symptomatic.

Remember those cruise ships? They are great petri dishes. You know the
virus reached everyone it could in those ships. From [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/24/us/diamond-princess-cruise-ship-asymptomatic-tests/index.html)

>The CDC's report [.. detailed the] cruise ship, the Grand Princess,
>which was in limbo for days off the coast of California. Of the 469
>people with available test results on that ship, 78 -- or 17% -- of
>them tested positive for coronavirus

and

>Nearly half of the Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers and crew
>who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were asymptomatic

So the virus can infect 17% of a population, out of those 50% will be
symptomatic. Let's assume it is those ppl will show up as confirmed
cases in global tallies that we read about everyday, out of which 20%
will die.

Then the population death rate will be

```python
np.round((0.5 * 0.17 * 0.20) * 100.0, 2)
```

```text
Out[1]: 1.7
```

This is Spanish Flu territory.

Some say, okay, but in those cruise ships there was too much
contact. Well that's why you reduce contact because it is as bad as
the FRICKIN SPPANISH FLU. We gain time, reduce deaths, in the meantime
work on treatment etc.

Here's what happened in the Czech Republic after they imposed
mandatory mask-wearing on March 18th. The daily increase in cases has
dropped from over 20% before the #masks4all rule to just 6%"

Testing capacity in Germany will be increased by up to factor 10 to up
to 400,000 a day (!) by doing pooled testing. E.g mix 16 samples and
if negative - all are negative, otherwise binary search for the
positve(s). Could of course be used worldwide"

"@Peston

@michaelgove said just now that the difficulty in increasing number of

reagents'. Well I've just talked to the Chemical Industries
Association, which represents the UK's very substantial chemicals
industry. It has contacted its members, and they've said there is no
shortage of the relevant reagents"
