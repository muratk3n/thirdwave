Biden: "As a summit commitment of the United States, I will issue a
presidential policy directive that establishes combating corruption as
a core national security interest and democratic responsibility, and I
will lead efforts internationally to bring transparency to the global
financial system, go after illicit tax havens, seize stolen assets,
and make it more difficult for leaders who steal from their people to
hide behind anonymous front companies"

"Plug Power has developed a new 1kW ProGen fuel cell system for small
scale robotics, automatic guided vehicles (AGVs), unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), and other aerospace applications.

The new system represents Plug Power’s expanding product line through
its acquisition of EnergyOr, a Montreal-based fuel cell systems
company with experience in aerospace fuel cell system design and
application, completed in June last year"

Why is California suffering rolling blackouts?  Difficult to balance
increasing intermittent resources, reduced reserve gas capacity and

ease the pressure"

The marketing around the "Google Killer" Wolfram Alfa was mostly bunk
tho.. SW goes back and forth being ignored and posturing
needlessly...

He is a serious scientist, no doubt there.

---

Our uni legend had it one our CS profs, my Alg I teacher as it turns
out, had code in Mathematica. He worked with SW's ppl I think. During
lecture he'd slip up sometimes and say "cellular automata" when it was
totally unrelated so we guessed this was his area of research. The
area attracted some smart people is what Im trying to say.

---

Stephen Wolfram might have something promising; starting from
computation, emergent physics cld be possible.. You'd hear things abt
his group over the years, one mathematician I know stumbled upon an
invention that had to do solving PDEs using cellular automata, and he
was piled on by Wolfram's people, even threathening legal action for a
patent issue?  Anyway, u gotta be wary of these kind of motherfonkers
tucked away somewhere toiling away on arcane knowhow.. They might just
stumble upon the real thing -- 42.

*The Atlantic*: "By the end of March, Mina had identified a culprit:
'There’s little ability for a central command unit to pool all the
resources from around the country,' he said at a Harvard event. 'We
have no way to centralize things in this country short of declaring
martial law.' It took several more months for him to find a solution
to this problem, which is to circumvent it altogether. In the past
several weeks, he has become an evangelist for a total revolution in
how the U.S. controls the pandemic. Instead of restructuring daily
life around the American way of testing, he argues, the country should
build testing into the American way of life. The wand that will
accomplish this feat is a thin paper strip ... It is a coronavirus
test.

Mina says that the U.S. should mass-produce these inexpensive and
relatively insensitive tests—unlike other methods, they require only a
saliva sample—in quantities of tens of millions a day. These tests,
which can deliver a result in 15 minutes or less, should then become a
ubiquitous part of daily life .. The tests Mina describes already
exist: They are sitting in the office of e25 Bio, a small start-up in
Cambridge, Massachusetts; half a dozen other companies are working on
similar products"

Truman was **not** a simple farmer. Politicians might allow such
things to be said abt themselves or even help spread the commentary to
help their "man of the people" image. Reality is different. Truman had
lots of experience before he became President. County judge, Civil
Works admin, Senator, worked at a high-profile commitee, Vice
President, *then* Potus.

"But anyone can serve at the highest office look at Truman he was a
simple farmer"

Apparently it is becoming a thing in Thailand

That's funny

"A prominent student protest leader in Thailand has been arrested on
charges of sedition as pro-democracy rallies continued across the
country.Parit Chiwarak, 22, whose arrest was livestreamed on social
media, was stopped on the outskirts of Bangkok on Friday night. As he
was physically carried into a car, he raised his hand in a
three-fingered salute – a gesture borrowed from the Hunger Games that
is used by protesters and symbolises opposition to the military-backed
government"

"'What I’ve noticed is that, as opposed to everything I’ve done my
entire career, the biggest difference is that in the future there will
be no lines on the battlefield,' Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the
[JCS], said.... Hyten who will be a keynote speaker at September’s
Defense News Conference — laid out a vision in which every force can
both defend itself and have a deep-strike capability to hold an enemy
at bay, built around a unified command-and-control system.

'A naval force can defend itself or strike deep. An air force can
defend itself or strike deep. The Marines can defend itself or strike
deep,' he said. 'Everybody.'

That 'everybody' includes international partners, Hyten added, as the
U.S. operates so often in a coalition framework that this plan only
works if it can integrate others"

"Arab League blasts Turkey's cross-border operations into Iraq"

If the "outside countries" want to help, maybe they check their
actions as to not force the core ME to act this way.

"[UAE actions are] unfair and bitter for the Palestinians. But it
corresponds to an irreversible trend: It is no longer Israel , but
above all Iran and increasingly also Turkey that are perceived by many
Arab states as dangerous 'intruders' in their own region"
