Plus there is that annoying detail that US played a huge part turning
China what it is today.

Even if you were correct, that CH is doing well, and here I'll give
you the Fareed Zakaria response; what if you are not China? Get it?
He is trying to say 'what if you are one of those countries who for
whatever reason do not have capable ppl at the helm but now you are
stuck, bcz u have no democracy, you cannot change them'.

The results [I
shared](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2016/11/why-is-democracy-better.md)
on democracy show clearly, with all things considered, overall,
democracy works, so by default countries should prefer that. I dont
think anyone can replicate China's freak experiment.

Cool.. `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/` has `charge_now` file for
notebook battery stat, `charge_full` for full (non-100 number). Do
little math u get pow status in perc on the cmd line.

‚ÄúWhen the express terms of a statute give us one answer and
extratextual considerations suggest another, it‚Äôs no contest. Only the
written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.‚Äù

"@EFF

Legislators are repeatedly told to support building slower networks
because they appear to be "cheaper" to build. But the reality is that
low expectations have cost the public billions, with little to show
for it"

"@FCHEA_News

A new report from @CalEnergy estimates that \#hydrogen fuel will be
near price parity with gasoline by 2025! This is great news for the
future of \#zeroemission \#fuelcell transportation!"

WHEN ARE WE GETTING A FOUNDATION TRILOGY?

---

How come the old man did not see the significance of the 0th
Wave. Amazing. I feel like that telephatic robot in *Foundation*
series who discovered 0th Law of Robotics. Maybe I should call myself
Giskard.

---

Just as large diff between 0th wave and 1st. At one point you are
hunting, gathering, the next the wild animal becomes a sheep and then
your girlfriend. Major difference.

---

Excellent. If you were back at those times, there'd come a time,
within a span of ~50 yrs, before / after of the place would look
drastically different. Before would be carriages, slow life, hand-sewn
clothing, after, train, steam ships, manufactured clothing, much
faster life. Diff between two waves. They are always drastic.

"@TheDaiLlew

'Middlemarch is the greatest novel of the 19th Century, charting the
monumental shift from agrarian to industrial England and the
intellectual sea changes of the Romantic era, and if any Bronte Boys
come around here saying different, they‚Äôll be shitting teeth for a
month.'"
