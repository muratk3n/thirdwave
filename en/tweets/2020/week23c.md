I have two other methods to run that difference, significance check,
and could probably dig up a third. Interested parties need to learn
this shit before talking shop on cause and effect.

Of course statistical significance is one thing, practical
significance is another. That's another level of critical judgement
that needs to applied to the result. As the Gelman / Hill book says

>Statistical significance does not equal practical significance. For
>example, if the estimated predictive effect of height on earnings were
>10 dollar per inch with a standard error of 2 dollar, this would be
>statistically but not practically significant. Conversely, an estimate
>of 10,000 dollar per inch with a standard error of 10,000 dollar would
>not be statistically significant, but it has the possibility of being
>practically significant (and also the possibility of being zero; that
>is what ‚Äúnot statistically significant‚Äù means)."

Impeachement was on 2019-12-18? We look at approval data before and
after, 6 months before, 2 months after,

[Data](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_topline.csv)

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/tmp/approval_topline.csv',parse_dates=True,index_col='modeldate')
df = df[['approve_estimate','disapprove_estimate']]
df = df.sort_index(by='modeldate')

df['net'] = df.approve_estimate - df.disapprove_estimate
event = '2019-12-18'; d1 = '2019-06-01'; d2 = '2020-03-01'
df1 = df[(df.index > d1) & (df.index < event)]
df2 = df[(df.index > event) & (df.index < d2)]
print (df1['net'].mean())
print (df2['net'].mean())
```

```text
-11.725994522613066
-9.786354182648402
```

Net approval was lower before impeachement than after.

Is this significant? Let's compare means of both samples, using Welch
two sample t-test,

```python
from statsmodels.stats.weightstats import ttest_ind
print ( ttest_ind(df1['net'], df2['net']) )
```

```text
(-14.416007336365869, 3.970177267005474e-42, 814.0)
```

The hypothesis that they are the same is rejected. Statistically these
numbers are different. So impeachement helped Trump by 2% points.

One needs to look at the data and run statistical tests to answer that
question. See above.

"Impeachement hurt Trump"

Trump was never the guy to calm things down. He was the agent of chaos
himself.. But I dont think that's the US Presidency.
