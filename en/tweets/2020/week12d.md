Corona: 39K more cases in one day, death rate 10.5 %.

I added time series retrieval section, with a rough plot. The data has
country level confirmed numbers tho.

"At present, it is tempting to estimate the case fatality rate by
dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed
cases. The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case
fatality rate"

This is exactly right.

Phase 2: A New Normal Returns in Summer

Phase 3: Massive/ Universal Testing & Isolation of those with the virus combined with better 
therapies

Phase 4: Vaccine"

"@EamonJavers

I just got off the phone with former Bush NEC Director Larry
Lindsey. He says everyone is missing the ‚Äúbig bazooka‚Äù in the Senate
bill- massive payroll relief for small businesses in section 1105. He
says it could impact up to 80 MILLION American jobs.

Lawrence Lindsey says the section provides loans to small businesses
to cover payroll, and hugely incentivizes them not to lay anyone
off. The measure:

- covers employees making up to $100,000 per year

- loans forgiven ENTIRELY after 4 months if companies don‚Äôt lay anyone off"
