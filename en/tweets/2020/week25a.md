When that Nokia pivot to MS happened, lots of Unix, open source ppl I
knew were upset... Nokia should've gone forward with that MeeGo build
their own thing, in Europe.

I'd ditch droid in a second if this becomes viable. Anything that
gives me a true Unix cmd line, and wont trigger 1 GB updates, and not
based on f-ing Java is good.

Has Android compatibility; Cool.

Great; guy corrected his rough drone aerodynamics calc after I told

Watched *Rampage* in a foreign language. Looks like a good movie.

---

*The Atlantic*: "[In the show *Cops* t]he arrestees are often referred
to as 'bad guys,' and they get no backstory, no biography beyond what
they volunteer to the officers in front of them. They‚Äôre human beings
reduced to the sum of their rap sheets, or to their mental and
emotional state on the particular day that the cameras are
rolling. The cops don‚Äôt get much more by way of characterization,
although they occasionally throw out one-liners to the accompanying
cameramen to acknowledge the viewers at home.

I was reminded of this detail when Officer Tou Thao of the Minneapolis
Police Department cracked, 'This is why you don‚Äôt do drugs, kids,' to
the assembled crowd watching the killing of George Floyd in real
time. The line struck me as something someone might say if they had
grown up watching Cops, and had absorbed the show‚Äôs motifs as emblems
of police work. In Cops‚Äô world, the police are by default the good
guys, because theirs is the only point of view the camera
follows. Fleeing suspects must be captured because‚Äîon Cops‚Äîthey‚Äôre
always guilty of something. And the structure of the show‚Äôs acts,
punctuated by ad breaks, means that the good guys unfailingly capture
and overpower the bad guys in a matter of minutes.Never have these
qualities felt so out of touch.

That Cops was still in production shocked some people this week, given
how much it seemed like a relic of the late ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s, something
unearthed from a time capsule alongside The Tracey Ullman Show and the
'Just Say No' antidrug campaign. But that the series was finally
canceled by the Paramount Network, where it had moved after 25 seasons
on Fox, was less surprising"

Germany's culture code for itself is ORDNUNG. This is their
"body-image", how they see themselves, want to be. The code can
conjure up images of people walking in a single file, like automatons
but ORDER isn't necessarily that. It can also be an absence of
chaos. For an orderly process, you need to know the fundamentals of a
situation, then a system can be designed to handle it which works in a
way that makes it look easy.

Take Berlin U-Bahn, there is no charge at the station entrance. You
just freely walk in hop on the train. You have to have a ticket on you
when you are on the train, but there is no stringent check at early
entrance. This speeds up entry, exits. There are / can be checkers in
the trains, enough of them that if you make a habit of not paying
you'll eventually get caught. So everyone buys a ticket. Fast,
"orderly". No chaos.

John Adams: "As he explained to Jefferson, [Adams thought a] simple,
perfect democracy had never yet existed. The whole people were
incapable of deciding much of anything, even on the small scale of a
village. He had had enough experience with town meetings at home to
know that in order for anything to be done certain powers and
responsibilities had to be delegated to a moderator, a town clerk, a
constable, and, at times, to special committees"
