It turns out manufacturing PMI (below) is a good indicator, so use
it. This is a fulcrum point, this ain't school, where student is
expected to cover all bases going through some list defined by
others. This is a hunt, a foraging party, for survival where one need
tries to get an advantage. Science is very much conducted this way
too. Be too cool for school.

Battery swapping instead of waiting for recharge (bcz bitch BEV

N batteries, market needs N + N batteries, half of them unused at any

cobalt mining). Standardization wld be pain, Mercedes bats need to be
same as Toyota bats etc.

The vision for peace is not my \#1 preference but at least the map
looks less patchy than some of the earlier plans.

But if Israel wants Jordan Valley to cut Pals off from possible
influence coming from Jordan, the optics of the proposed scheme is
bad. It looks like giving ppl a semblance of a state and kind of put
them in a desert island. Their only allies can be Egypt.

Isn't Jordan kind of an Israeli protectorate anyway? What kind of
threat could come from there?

"It's been a long, long time since there's been legitimate price
discovery in the markets. At the end of the day, when you look at even
equities, equities are ultimately the derivative of the credit
markets. They're just the thing at the bottom of the capital
stack. Over time, people compare dividend yield on stocks with yields
on debt.

That entire structure has been distorted by monetary authorities
effectively underpricing the front end of the term structure of risk
reward."

If by this time fossil is still widely used, targeted sabotage will
become legitimate. Extreme elements will take action. Let's fix this
thing before it gets there.

of renewable hydrogen production could halve over the next ten years,
putting Australia is in prime position to become a leading global
supplier of a green fuel that will beat even ‚Äúunabated‚Äù fossil fuels"

Out of the three, GF might have had the better deal. Great career,
beat Frazier, lost to Ali, both decisively. On a talk show later on
with the other two, he was still in form, chipper, all marbles
there. Ali was __gone__. He could barely speak.

*2020-1-27 22:45:8*

Ah - Ali was *Mellow Meadow*. Overdid the fighting. He could have said
"Fraz, u got beaten by the guy I beat, see ya". Leave it at 1-1 with a
tilt towards him.

*2020-1-27 22:34:28*

---

It's true the 3rd Ali-Frazier fight took too much out of them ("we
went to Manilla as champs, came back as old men"). Some style pairings
are a natural tie. No need to push it. Foreman beats Frazier, Ali
beats Foreman, then Ali has trouble with Frazier. The calculus is out
of whack. Leave it at that. I bet Ali's Parkinsons had something to do
with that last fight

Hitting Baydƒ±n on social security is a first layer, reptilian level
attack

by __that guy__, then you might __die__ bcz you will have __no

Fin shows constantly talk about stocks bcz these are names that are
familiar to most people. SBUX, AMZN - "oh well, I just had coffee at
Starbucks and shopped from Amazon". But the futures market, the
curency market, the bond market are all much larger than the equities
market (stocks). Right off the bat we see fin shows are not there to
inform, but to entertain and to pander. If they talked about
Eurodollar futures, then u have to do a song and dance abt what that
is, blah blah.. then the viewer checked out dude! The ratings are
down. Like, bummer. Back to stocks.
