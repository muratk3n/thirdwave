That's not why. If you are really looking for something, you need to
look for an inherent trait that goes way back. What is a major diff
between man and woman historically?  Having to carry and care for a
child. That would be it; caring for offspring would drastically
reorient risk/reward calculus, safety of the child would be
paramount. If there is anything inherently better with women around
COVID crisis fighting, it has to be this.

If you are *really* looking for something.

I work through directories. Any new concept, small project becomes a
directory, all work is there. Every supporting material also goes into
dir. Once done, a tutorial is created out of the subject, PDF books
get archived or `pdftk`'d into PDF booklets also get archived. Then
the directory is deleted.

There is only one dir active at one time, and maybe one future project
dir. That's it.

"@alexandrapullin

I wonder whether a side effect of lockdown will be a general exodus of
families from London to leafier surrounds. More working from home
means the commuting isn't such an factor, bigger gardens, more house
for your money, etc"

I like the picture (from [this](https://theconversation.com/science-fiction-builds-mental-resiliency-in-young-readers-135513) article).
A scifi stock photo apparently, not a movie, or a book.

The market will regulate itself bro.. Consumer will benefit.. like a
win-win yo. 

"Frontier's own chart, below, shows the company's estimate of the
profitability of its current fiber assets. Note that the company
itself estimates that by 2031 the revenues from fiber would exceed
costs and thus deliver increases in profit. Note also that for the
first five years, the company would lose money on fiber. Fiber has
high upfront costs (like a house), but it pays off handsomely over
time. The inability to capitalize on superior investment opportunities
because they take too long to mature is the very definition of
dysfunctional short-termism. ...

The revelations from Frontier's bankruptcy filings don't end
there. Equally important is how Frontier cultivated, maintained, and
abused its monopolies. ISPs like Frontier know exactly where they have
monopolies, and therefore know exactly who has no choice and therefore
is not worth spending money on.

Frontier's documents reveal that the company treats its status as the
monopoly provider of high-speed Internet access for 1.6 million
households as a uniquely identifiable asset. Frontier wants investors
to know that it can precisely demarcate its monopoly territories
because it wants to show investors where it can get money (to repay
its debt and get out of bankruptcy) by charging a captive audience
more and delivering less.

The fact that Frontier‚Äîand its competitors‚Äîtreat monopolies as a
bankable asset would seem a sign that there should be some oversight"

"[FCs] are scalable so you can have them small enough for a cellphone
tower or large enough for a building. In the U.S., fuel-cell forklifts
have already become a commercial product and are replacing
battery-electric forklifts in warehouses across the country. They‚Äôre
really attractive in warehouses operating 24 hours a day because they
can refill in a matter of minutes"

"@CaFCP

There‚Äôs an ongoing joke in the California Fuel Cell Partnership
(CaFCP) office that whatever situation Keith Malone walks into, he‚Äôll
eventually find a connection with somebody.

'Three degrees of Keith they call me,' Malone says as he chuckles down
the phone. And they‚Äôre not wrong. Malone is well known in the fuel
cell and hydrogen space for his work with the CaFCP ‚Äì an
industry/government collaboration aimed at expanding the market for
fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) to help create a cleaner, more
energy-diverse future with zero emission vehicles.

'It started on my first day on the job with the partnership‚Äôs
communications team,' Malone tells H2 View as he continues his story.

'I went to a conference with my colleagues and I dropped by the booth
of one of our members and there was a friend of mine from high
school. We were surprised to see each other and what was more
surprising was the fact that this friend worked closely with the
CaFCP.'

'From then began this series of coincidences where I was seeing people
that I knew or had a fairly strong connection to. It kind of blew
people away, and the joke ‚Äòthree degrees of Keith‚Äô was born.'
