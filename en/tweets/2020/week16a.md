Industrialized meat is fine; efficient, clean if inspected
properly. Stay away from freaky wild animals.

We also increasingly subtitute knowledge in place of hard materials
during Third Wave - plastics, for instance, are a complete
fabrication, a material that does not exist in nature. Constructing
meat from its base essentials, without animals, will be IMO the new
way we increasingly eat meat.

"The Case Against Wet Markets.. Live wildlife, however, is too risky
to remain at wet markets. ‚ÄúThe lowest-hanging fruit to lessen the
likelihood of future pandemics is to close those markets where we have
large congregations of wild species for commercial purposes,‚Äù Steven
Osofsky, a professor of wildlife health"

Not cool. This guy is American, by citizenship and by culture. 

"The Trump campaign probably never expected to feature [Gary Locke]
either. But there he is, in a brief clip included in a montage of the
former vice president meeting with various Chinese officials. Locke is
standing between two Chinese flags (and next to an American
one). Biden is walking toward him, with his head bowed in a way that
makes him look deferential.It‚Äôs a standard theatrical move that Biden
often does when he sees old political allies. And Locke is an old
Biden ally.

But he isn‚Äôt Chinese. He‚Äôs Chinese American. And though the photo was
taken at an event in Beijing, it was taken while Locke was serving in
the same administration as Biden‚Äîas the American ambassador to
China. Before that, he was the first Asian American governor of a
state not called Hawaii. A section of the Wing Luke Museum of the
Asian Pacific American Experience in Seattle is devoted to him.[Read:
Meet Gary Locke, America‚Äôs new ambassador to China]In other words:
Locke is not a Chinese official, as the Trump campaign made him out to
be, apparently because of the way he looks and because he was standing
next to a Chinese flag.‚ÄúIt is racial stereotyping at its worst. Asian
Americans‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre second-, third-, or fourth-generation, will
always be viewed as foreigners,‚Äù Locke told me today. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt say
that about second- or third-generation Irish Americans or Polish
Americans. No one would even think to include them in a picture when
you‚Äôre talking about foreign government officials.‚Äù

Locke is justifiably bewildered by being thrown into the middle of the
campaign. ‚ÄúFor a lot of Asian Americans, it‚Äôs not surprising, but it
is disheartening,‚Äù he said.[Read: The other problematic
outbreak]Locke‚Äôs father was part of the Normandy invasion, then was
ordered along with the rest of the Fifth Armored Division to the
Battle of the Bulge.

Labeled administrations on the [Gini
plot](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#gini). Ineq
rose under W, net gain only under HW and DJT (so far). Granted Obama
admin began during GFC aftermath, things improved later starting '12,
but looking at the net he finished in the red. Same for Clinton.
