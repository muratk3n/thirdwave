# Week 42

Just saw F24 bit on green tech and they talked abt Airbus H2
plans. This is serious... And why shouldnt it be? H2 has been used in
space rockets for years.

Court packing/busting filibuster/adding states all make sense to
me. We were in cooperate/cooperate for decades, but we are obviously
in defect/defect now, so we need a punishment period and probably a

Daily Poster: "If you get your news from the political press and
television ads, you might think the¬†US supreme court¬†is a forum that
only adjudicates disputes over the most hot-button religious and civil
rights issues. What you would not know is that while the court does
periodically rule on those important matters, it spends as much or
more of its time using business-related cases to help billionaires and
corporations rig the economy against ordinary Americans.

In light of that, Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs US supreme court nomination must
be understood as the culmination of cynical tactics that Republicans
have perfected over the last two decades. The strategy is
straightforward: they nominate plutocrat-compliant judges knowing that
the corporate-owned media and political system will make sure
confirmation battles focus on partisan wrangling and high-profile
social issues ‚Äì but not also on the economic issues that justices
often decide"

Covid killed 1 mil so far, roughly in one year, mostly old.

Traffic accidents kill and injure just as much, mostly young.

"Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death among young
people between 10 and 24 years, according to a new report published by
WHO. The report,¬†Youth and Road Safety, says that nearly 400 000 young
people under the age of 25 are killed in road traffic crashes every
year. Millions more are injured or disabled"

Invading Iraq, say for democracy, would undoubtedly goad Iran into
action (Iraq has majority Shite, same as Iran). And once beligerent
action starts, others would have a reason to step in. The endgame
still could be a whopping Iranian invasion.

TR? The odd thing is, after 2003 many nationalists in TR started to
get quesy... A bestselling 2004 novel *Metal Fƒ±rtƒ±na* (Metal Storm)
for instance depicts tiggers being invaded. But u r a NATO ally and a
democracy.. Why would u care? I remember thinking "what crawled up
your behind this time, f-nuts?". They are bothered some inane thing or
another all the time.. But then I realized if u think non-democracies
are in danger and you see yourself as one, then you would perceive a
threat, wouldn't you? All of a sudden there don't be a coup every 10
years, minorities might get representation. Alas post 2015 we saw a
decrease of democracy and a rise of nationalism. So maybe people who
saw a threat did act.

There are many tricks in self-guided education. A simple one, and it
works even for highest level of mathematics, is proving a theorem in a
book which already has the answer. Cover the answer, try to solve; if
successful, great. If not, look at the solution, but now we see it
with all kinds of questions in our head, we learn more from the
answer.

These tricks can be taught in a seperate class on their own.

Maybe certifier can do more admin work in that sense, but in my
approach, ed will be mostly self-guided. "Not all kids can do
that". Maybe. But maybe not all kids are meant to sit down and stare
at writings all day long either. Wide-spread ed as its pursued today
pigeonholes people in so many ways.

"But in your ed system how would kids receive, and do homeworks? If
certifier will not be a teacher anymore?"

Wanting to come across as a first-rate power.. Anatolians want it so
bad. But I think these niggers confuse acting out end-goal with
actually being it. "If I act the end goal I'll be it". Have a white
house'y place, with briefings given other than that the exec. This is
some retarded dumb ass shit...  What happened to the process? US ended
up being what it is as a side-effect of many factors of its near past
and geo. It didnt *try* to be it, and even now, many are unhappy with
the state of empire. So how can a country hailing from the sidelines
of modernity simply acting out the end-product simply be that end
product?

"And, at the end of September, it was announced HS2 had been piloting
solar and hydrogen powered cabins at site locations ... Designed and
built by a firm called AJC Trailers, and supplied by GAP Group, the
buildings use solar panels backed up by a hydrogen
fuel-cell. .. Designed to be low noise, they emit only water vapor. In
relatively simple terms, a fuel-cell combines hydrogen and oxygen to
generate electricity, heat and water. Across a period of 21 weeks, HS2
said 16 of the cabins saved 112 metric tons of carbon"

Technobabbling centrism had a certain pull on Dems from another
direction.. Politics, as a job, is mainly knowledge work. It deals
with information, decision, having to adjust to an existing canon (the
law).. All that cld pull them towards financiers, Silicon Valley
honchos, etc. 

Technical knowledge is good of course, we want technically aware
lawmakers, like LBJ was in his heyday (the Apollo Moon program was his
idea), but if this turns into a *class conciousness*, we have a big
problem. Low income ppl lose representation, and Dems lose power bcz
white collar, aflluent folk, forming a mere 20% + concentrated in big
cities, cannot be of help in deciding most elections.

I don't like moorings. Propellers, already used for mobility, can keep
