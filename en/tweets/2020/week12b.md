"A normal or up-sloped yield curve indicates yields on longer-term
bonds may continue to rise, responding to periods of economic
expansion. When investors expect longer-maturity bond yields to become
even higher in the future, many would temporarily park their funds in
shorter-term securities [buying them decreasing yield] in hopes of
purchasing longer-term bonds later [selling them decreasing yield,
difference, the curve goes higher] for higher yields...  In a rising
interest rate environment, it is risky to have investments tied up in
longer-term bonds".

Rising IR environment is obviously the result of growth, so "the
curve" in many ways represents investors' overall view on growth and
recession.

Hah. Building factories, trying to to look "so eager to work (risking
disease to build u see, knowing full well it'd be not allowed)", is
for the image "trying to meet demand bro". A media tactic, attemtping
to create an illusion of demand.

There is no demand.

Batteries are an inferior technology.

This is the completely wrong direction to take for our global goal to
replace fossil fuels.

Another good metric - total market cap to GDP (idea from
[here](https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1239871604190064643))

Basically your stock market cannot be worth more than the economic
value you are creating (GDP) - so anything above 100% for this metric
is a bubble. 

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapgdp.asp):
"To calculate the total value of all publicly traded stocks in the
U.S., most analysts use The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, which is
an index that represents the value of all stocks in the
U.S. markets. The quarterly GDP is used as the denominator in the
ratio calculation".

I belive this is also called the Buffett Indicator. Wilshire Index
from [FRED](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#wilshire) seems to capture it. 

I don't know about anyone else, but post 2016 looks like a freaky bubble.

Daaaaaam! [VIX saw](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#vix) 82 yesterday! 

Was this the highest volatility ever?

```python
import pandas_datareader.data as web
start=datetime.datetime(1920, 1, 1)
end=datetime.datetime(today.year, today.month, today.day)
df = web.DataReader("^GSPC", 'yahoo', start, end)['Adj Close']
vix = (df.pct_change()*100.0).rolling(20).std()*np.sqrt(252)
print (vix.argmax())
```

```text

OK.. 1929 was a little higher. As in the Great Crash 1929!

Rent is key. Restaurant, shop loses customers, can fire staff to fit to reduced demand but still has to pay the same amount of rent.

Some Nano crypto information - for wallet I use Atomic Wallet.

Anyone can get some initial N$ by going to a site, clicking on some
captcha, sometimes not even that,

[https://nano-faucet.org](https://nano-faucet.org)

[https://www.freenanofaucet.com](https://www.freenanofaucet.com)

enter ur receiving address and voila! Sites limit usage per address
per day to prevent abuse, but this is a simple, efficient way to
distribute some coin...

Atomic Wallet allows purchase of Nano (or any other coin) through a
credit card from inside the app.

Nano requires no mining (a stupid idea anyway).

My only criticism of non-expanding monetary base notwithstanding (also
true for all other coins), N$ looks very much like a third generation
coin, much better than "Satoshi" Hal Finney's Bitcoin.

[Corporate Profits vs SP500](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#sp500prof) -
we can see how they diverged from eachother big
time since 2016. I didnt have to adjust scale on either metric bcz S&P
index is calculated based on market cap anyway, which is intrinsically
connected to a dollar value. The idea for the graph came from
[here](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/profits-earnings-suggest-bear-market-far-over).

The project described below is __huge__. California will store H2 "in
vast underground caverns the size of the Empire State Building". It is
known that salt caverns can store H2 for long periods of time. Cal
will get renewable electricity from Utah, and other places through a
few high-voltage lines, it will use them to generate H2. Why do that?
Because renewable source can be intermittent (hence the need for
storage).

How to go from H2 back to electricity again in order to distribute it
within the state? Here LADWP will use gas turbines that take H2 as
fuel, and generate electricity. Turbines will be built by Mitsubishi.

Article says "each salt cavern will hold 5,500 tonnes of H2, enough to
fill up a million fuel cell vehicles, representing storage 84 times
greater than a 1.2GWh battery, according to LADWP"

There is no way to reach this scale, in any shape or form, other than
through renewable fuels.
