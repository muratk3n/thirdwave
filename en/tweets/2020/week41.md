# Week 41


t Hooft: "Fast moving classical variables can generate quantum
mechanical behavior. We demonstrate how this can happen in a
model. The key point is that in classically (ontologically) evolving
systems one can still define a conserved quantum energy ...

It will be shown that quantum mechanical correlation functions can be
most easily explained if we assume the existence of very high
frequency oscillations, which give rise to energy levels way beyond
the regime of the Standard Model. When these fast oscillating
quantities are handled as classical variables that have to be smeared
over short, finite periods of time, one obtains the familiar operator
structure for quantum mechanical systems. ...

The classical system we start with is absolutely classical, hence it
does away with collapse axioms, measurement problems, pilot waves and
many worlds. All we need is fast variables such as the vacuum
fluctuations due to heavy particles, many of which must be unknown
today. The fast variables are moving completely classically, but too
fast to be followed by the ‚Äòobservers‚Äô in our model"

Goood. Unix utility `mpv` can play `.pls` URLs, handy for
streaming. Pick one with low bitrate, u can replace radio.

Termux on Android has `mpv` (again command line, on a smartphone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Noone did - except Merkel. At institutional level, Europe..  In a 2011
book Rifkin talks all about it. Between 2003-06 he had major access,
and Germany made major commitments around this time. If DE/EU is
further ahead right now, that's why.

"If Rifkin made such big waves in 01-02, did govs listen and plan?"

"[A Penn State] team integrated water purification technology into a
new proof-of-concept design for a sea water electrolyzer ..
[Researcher states: 'T]he holy grail of producing hydrogen would be to
combine the sea water and the wind and solar energy found in coastal
and offshore environments'.

Despite the abundance of sea water, it is not commonly used for water
splitting. Unless the water is desalinated prior to entering the
electrolyzer ‚Äî an expensive extra step ‚Äî the chloride ions in sea
water turn into toxic chlorine gas, which degrades the equipment and
seeps into the environment.

To prevent this, the researchers inserted a thin, semipermeable
membrane, originally developed for purifying water in the reverse
osmosis (RO) treatment process. The RO membrane replaced the
ion-exchange membrane commonly used in electrolyzers"

While we r at it, why not deodorant? These f-ing corporations load
