SS is responsible for foreign policy, its intent, execution, and one
clear adminstrative work they do is running the embassies. And spies
usually assume a diplomat cover, and/or need the embassy as a
go-through point. Ergo, SS can allow / deny certain individuals, spies
perhaps in a country, influencing intelligence ops in that country,
effecting on-the-ground events. SecState matters.

"How can a SecState influence events on the ground? As in underhanded stuff"

It is concoction. Theather. Look; someone like Tucker Carlson, who
recently started to talk about some traditionally left issues (this is
how far, and low the Dems had fallen, their abandoned ideas were
picked up by others) is pretty big anti-abortion guy right? Well, but
his religion, Presbyterianism, is not strictly anti-abortion. In fact
none of them are! This guy is the only one! He jokes about it.. and
the rest of the joke goes, there is only one other Presb, a woman who
is that way, and he is married to her. Now forget one side
"imploring", trying to "convince", "one up" the other side. Imagine
that hand that goes out in the world, weeds out all likely candidates
and picks the only Presbyterian *in the world* who is
anti-abortion.. You can't fight this. The stage is set. With a certain
line-up you will get a certain theather. Pre-determined. Now TS
exceeded his programming so to speak, talks about some other stuff,
and we love seeing Glenn Greenwald on Fox. But there is a certain
institutional setup in play here, which can't be fought by more
punditry from the "other side". There is serious money to be made from
it too.. So much of it in fact, even Tubers down the line have been
feasting on the left-overs for years!  Forget mainstream!

The game is agree on all primary issues, raise a ruckus on secondary
bullshit ones, on "4G" - Green, Gays, Guns, God. Richard Fucking Nixon
founded the EPA, but pfff, that's so yesterday. Up until a few years
not a single Republican would touch an environmental issue with a
ten-foot pole.

"But why do pundits jump up and down, arguing all the time?"

True. US has [faux polarization](2018/05/polarization.md). 

Caitlin Johnstone: "When you look at US politics, it appears as though
there are two mainstream political factions that very strongly
disagree with one another. 'Divided' is a word that comes up a
lot. 'Polarized' is another. It is of course true that a whole lot of
emotion flows between these two factions, and most of it is indeed
negative. The hot topics of any given news cycle in America will
typically involve more than one story pertaining to the vitriolic
enmity between them.  But beneath all the hurled insults and heated
debates, these two factions are actually furiously agreeing with one
another. They‚Äôre agreeing the entire time"

t Hooft: "Fast moving classical variables can generate quantum
mechanical behavior. We demonstrate how this can happen in a
model. The key point is that in classically (ontologically) evolving
systems one can still define a conserved quantum energy ...

It will be shown that quantum mechanical correlation functions can be
most easily explained if we assume the existence of very high
frequency oscillations, which give rise to energy levels way beyond
the regime of the Standard Model. When these fast oscillating
quantities are handled as classical variables that have to be smeared
over short, finite periods of time, one obtains the familiar operator
structure for quantum mechanical systems. ...

The classical system we start with is absolutely classical, hence it
does away with collapse axioms, measurement problems, pilot waves and
many worlds. All we need is fast variables such as the vacuum
fluctuations due to heavy particles, many of which must be unknown
today. The fast variables are moving completely classically, but too
fast to be followed by the ‚Äòobservers‚Äô in our model"

Noone did - except Merkel. At institutional level, Europe..  In a 2011
book Rifkin talks all about it. Between 2003-06 he had major access,
and Germany made major commitments around this time. If DE/EU is
further ahead right now, that's why.

"If Rifkin made such big waves in 01-02, did govs listen and plan?"

"[A Penn State] team integrated water purification technology into a
new proof-of-concept design for a sea water electrolyzer ..
[Researcher states: 'T]he holy grail of producing hydrogen would be to
combine the sea water and the wind and solar energy found in coastal
and offshore environments'.

Despite the abundance of sea water, it is not commonly used for water
splitting. Unless the water is desalinated prior to entering the
electrolyzer ‚Äî an expensive extra step ‚Äî the chloride ions in sea
water turn into toxic chlorine gas, which degrades the equipment and
seeps into the environment.

To prevent this, the researchers inserted a thin, semipermeable
membrane, originally developed for purifying water in the reverse
osmosis (RO) treatment process. The RO membrane replaced the
ion-exchange membrane commonly used in electrolyzers"
