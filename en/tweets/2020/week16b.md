Rodrik: "COVID-19 may well not alter ‚Äì much less reverse ‚Äì tendencies
evident before the crisis. Neoliberalism will continue its slow
death. Populist autocrats will become even more
authoritarian. Hyper-globalization will remain on the defensive as
nation-states reclaim policy space. China and the US will continue on
their collision course. And the battle within nation-states among
oligarchs, authoritarian populists, and liberal internationalists will
intensify"

"@HelenHet20

The Eurozone is trapped because Italy can‚Äôt be a member without shared
debt, there won‚Äôt be shared debt with Italy inside the Eurozone, and
the Eurozone was designed to function without shared debt because
Italy wasn‚Äôt suppose to be in the Eurozone"

Yep. And that bending over backwards does not sit well w progs they

"@LemieuxLGM

This analysis by @DavidOAtkins is very good. The failure of Bernie to
win doesn't show that a progressive candidate/agenda can't win, it
shows that you can't win a Democratic primary by running against the
party"

Yeah... $e^{-x}$ is convex but $e^{-x^2}$ is not.. Sorry no cigar. So
sums of these, as in RBFS, would not guarantee global convergence. No

Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day;   

Teach him how to fish, and you lose a customer.

But give him a loan to buy a boat and net to fish, and he will end up
paying you all the fishes he catches.  You have a debt servant"

If this shit is sooo intrinsicly valueable why did UK, the inventor of
modern finance, decided to sell their gold? Maybe goldcuck fucknuts
are barking up the wrong tree - this thing is just another commodity
(perhaps even worse than some other commodities), you buy it when the
price seems favorable, and sell if there are enough morons willing to
pay. But there is no value in it, if enough ppl favored sock puppets,
sock puppets could be a currency.

"Gordon Brown [.. 1999-2002] UK Chancellor of the Exchequer (who later
became Prime Minister) ...  decided to sell approximately half of the
UK's gold reserves in a series of auctions"

"Lengthening Patent Terms by 10 Years is Exactly the Wrong Response to
COVID-19

Governments around the world are taking steps to make sure that
private corporations don‚Äôt use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse
to make unjustified monopoly profits. They‚Äôre doing that by ensuring
that governments can override patents and issue compulsory licenses
for COVID-19 related treatments, vaccines, and tools. Canada‚Äôs recent
COVID-19 bill authorizes the government to make and use patented
inventions as needed in fighting the pandemic. Governments in Chile,
Ecuador, Germany, and Israel have taken similar steps.

But in the U.S., lobbyists and lawyers for patent owners are pushing
our government to move in the exact opposite direction"

instead what they'll remember is that freak code. All u had to do was
pass that incidence matrix to `linprog` and you'd be done and the
student would go aha! But no, we had to get our freak on, now they are
lost and confused.

This confirms my thesis that Jesus, Moses were political leaders, and
speficially left politicians of their day. The billionaires, the ppl
in power at the time were the pharoah, the ceasar - i.e. ancient
mafia.  Jesus, Moses butted heads with this system, and were promptly
persecuted. An unfair system can only be possible with large
landowners present BTW, a direct extension of an agrarian structures -
a 60K year old construction at max.

These left leaders spoke of economic matters, but later their message
was coopted by "elders", morphing the message into moralistic issues,
perfectly in line with pre-Jesus, Moses paganist rituals when the
majority worshipped ancestor bones due to inheritance worries, again,
farm related and sacrificed young children. 

"'The Christianity we know today is not the Christianity of Jesus,'
says Professor Hudson.  Indeed the Judaism that we know today is not
the Judaism of Jesus either. The economist told Renegade Inc the
Lord‚Äôs Prayer, ‚Äòforgive us our sins even as we forgive all who are
indebted to us‚Äô, refers specifically to debt.

'Most religious leaders say that Christianity is all about sin, not
debt,' he says. 'But actually, the word for sin and debt is the same
in almost every language.'

'Schuld', in German, means ‚Äòdebt‚Äô as well as 'offense' or, 'sin'. It‚Äôs
'devoir' in French. It had the same duality in meaning in the
Babylonian language of Akkadian.‚Äù

The idea harks back to the concept of ‚Äòwergeld‚Äô, which existed in
parts of Europe and Babylonia, and set the value of a human life based
on their rank, paid as compensation to the family of someone who has
been injured or killed.

'The payment ‚Äì the Schuld or obligation ‚Äì expiates you of the injury
caused by the offense,' Dr Hudson said.

The Ten Commandments were about debt.

People tend to think of the Commandment ‚Äòdo not covet your neighbour‚Äôs
wife‚Äô in purely sexual terms but actually, the economist says it
refers specifically to creditors who would force the wives and
daughters of debtors into sex slavery as collateral for unpaid debt"

"@realSarahPolley

1/ This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

2/ Unsurprising that this movie doesn‚Äôt work ‚Äì the screenplay was a
dog‚Äôs breakfast.

3/So much heavy handed foreshadowing. The apocalyptic footage from
Wuhan, the super villain American president, the whistleblower dying,
the Russia/China border closed while people still claimed it was just
a flu, the warnings unheeded. Insulting to the audience's intelligence

4/And then ‚Äì that most annoying of horror/disaster movie tropes ‚Äì the
hapless idiots walking into disaster after disaster, all of which the
audience can see coming from a mile away.

5/The over the top details of world leaders and their wives falling
ill, the far fetched idea that industrialized countries wouldn‚Äôt have
proper protective gear for front line workers and
ventilators. Pleeeeaaase. This movie needed a script doctor.

6/ This movie even tries to cram in a political agenda ‚Äì an
on-the-nose critique of what capitalism looks like at its
worst. States competing for ventilators, the rich sheltering in lovely
places while the poor are trapped or still at work in unsafe
environments.

7/And the dystopian angle of this movie? The elderly have become so
disposable that young people still get together and party? No matter
how bad the world is, no one could believe we could ever get to that
point.

8/I don‚Äôt know who approved this script. I don‚Äôt know who thought it
was in shape to be released. People are just desperate for content I
guess"

"Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, told The
Times she was '80 per cent confident' that the vaccine being developed
by her team would work, with human trials due to begin in the next
fortnight.

The government signalled that it would be willing to fund the
manufacture of millions of doses in advance if results looked
promising. This would allow it to be available immediately to the
public if it were proven to work"
