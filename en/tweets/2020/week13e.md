Slowdown happens bcz of misallocation of credit (money). That misalloc
is due to ppl moving, improving in increments, follow the elevation to
go up but find self on top of a smaller hill, the bigger one is
elsewhere. Epitome of local optimum in optimization. What to do? Well
gotta climb down first and move over to the other mountain.

Great Depression SP500 Overlay. Red 2020, blue 1929.

<img width="340" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUA-NN9XsAAcq1k?format=png&name=small"/>

Interesting, in terms of percentages what happened during Depression
happened much faster now. Because we are talking bigger market caps,
changes in absolute numbers are huge.


```python
import pandas as pd, datetime
import pandas_datareader.data as web

today = datetime.datetime.now()
start=datetime.datetime(1920, 1, 1)
end=datetime.datetime(today.year, today.month, today.day)
df = web.DataReader("^GSPC", 'yahoo', start, end)[['Adj Close']]
df2 = df.copy()
df2 = df[df.index > '1929-09-01']
df2 = df2.head(1000)
df2 = df2.reset_index()
tmp = np.array(df[df.index > '2020-01-01'])
df2.ix[range(len(tmp)),'dep2'] = tmp
df2 = df2.set_index('Date')
df2.columns = ['Depression 1','Depression 2']
ax1 = df2['Depression 1'].plot(color='blue', grid=True)
ax2 = df2['Depression 2'].plot(color='red', grid=True, secondary_y=True)
h1, l1 = ax1.get_legend_handles_labels()
h2, l2 = ax2.get_legend_handles_labels()

As demand goes, so does oil.. With growth exp low the demand for oil would be less

"But I know a company which can grow as much". Sure, that is
possible. Others might think the same about other companies and buy
their shares, expecting that kind of growth. My point is all of these
people cannot be right at the same time. Hence, winners and losers.

Or at least there has to be.. If gov steps in and saves all the losers
then there is no market. Enter socialism.

It'd take 20 years to go to 150% with 2% growth.

In what future does the GDP increase to 150%? Every year it increases
2-3% if that. That "future" you speak of is too rosy, or "tulipy".

"So what if market cap / GDP was >150% Markets are about the future!"

Politics was supposed to balance that but in many places politicians
sold their souls to corporatism (another definition of fascism BTW).
