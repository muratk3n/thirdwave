Let's look at Brasil

```python
import pandas as pd, zipfile

with zipfile.ZipFile('/tmp/datapackage_zip.zip', 'r') as z:
    df =  pd.read_csv(z.open('data/gdp.csv'))
df = df[df['Country Code']=='BRA']
df = df.set_index('Year')
gdp = np.round(df.Value / 1e9,2)
gdp.plot()
plt.axvspan(2011,2011,color='y')
plt.savefig('bra.png')
```

What happened in 2011?

[searching..] Dilma becomes Prez. Ah. Well.. it looks like a huge peak
in GDP before that, coupled with commodity troubles, due to cycle
ending, things can go sideways easily, which happened for her. Dilma
was Lula's hand-picked successor obviously.

And, I have to add what followed as part of that "Car Wash" thing was
truly disgusting.

```python

    df =  pd.read_csv(z.open('archive/population.csv'))
print (df.columns)
pop_per_year = df.groupby('Year').sum()
print (pop_per_year.tail(3))
```

```text

Again, I say: Three clear messages emerge from the pandemic:
authoritarian leaders in one country, are a danger to humanity as a
whole; science-denying leaders in one country, are a danger to
humanity as a whole; neoliberal health systems, are a danger to
humanity as a whole"
