Simulated annealing looks interesting (global opt method), tho lacking
in some theoretical results (convergence).

"@AlbertMendonca

Greed reigns supreme in the US. The essence of capitalism. Even during
a crisis their @gop goal is to steal the jewelry off a dead man.

Maybe the Wall of China wasn't about keeping the barbarians out, it

"@BonnieGlaser

China is desperate to deflect blame for the virus. Now Beijing is
blaming Italy. Why not just leave the determination of origin to
scientists?"

"@Sabrina_McDa

All the major cruise lines are asking for bailouts from the
U.S. Government.

Yet, Disney Cruises sails under the Bahamian flag ... Celebrity
Cruises under Liberian/Maltese flags & Carnival Cruises under the
Panamanian flag - all to avoid U.S. taxes & employment law

Just sayin'"

It's weird, Reps didn't have to end up being such corporate
sluts. Appelbaum on why that could have happened.

"@BCAppelbaum

Free advice for the Senate: Table the big business bailout for
now. Boeing can wait. Pass what's most urgent: a small business
bailout/ expansion of unemployment benefits/funding for healthcare.

(This advice is also free, and perhaps more useful, for the House.)"

"@HawleyMO

It‚Äôs time for the Senate to get this done. People are hurting. And I
want to be clear: any relief for big corporations must limit executive
compensation, ban stock buybacks, & require companies to pay back
loans w/ interest. Or I‚Äôm not voting for it"

Current econ requires perfect sync. Do X constantly everyday so Y, Z
happens. Corona puts a wrench into that. Then a solution *could be* to
freeze all those dependencies in place. Have to go to work to pay rent
and credit cards? But oops, no work, then gov delays rent and cc
pay. Frozen in place. The market is needed for a different place,
different card, but that's for later. Post corona.

That doesnt seem to be US' style though.. In US, it's mo money for mo
problems, if not enough, even mo money, with bazookas, helicopters.

"@IsaacDovere

[Rand] Paul delayed a vote for several days by forcing an amendment on the Corona virus response, and then voted against the final bill. That bill includes a provision making testing free. 

So he got a test that he voted against everyone else being able to get"
