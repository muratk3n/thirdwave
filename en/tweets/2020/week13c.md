We all wish all this badness would go away with a great speech. That
ship has sailed my friend... Substantial changes, pronto. Otherwise we
are screwed.

"@zunguzungu

When you have so many people arguing that an unknown number of dead
bodies are a necessary price to pay to ensure the health of the
economy they fetishize, calling those people a 'death cult' isn't
hyperbole or exaggeration, it's literally the most adequate term to
describe them"

An Asterix image.. Looks like the Heil Hitler salute doesn't it?

That's what these fuckers were man.. the original Nazis.

Rome 1,2 and 3. And the Han. This ghosts of these cultures still
haunts us all. They are the ultimate pest.

Albert Uderzo RIP. I am a huge fan of Asterix. He portrayed the Romans
very well.

Actually not even project, calculate dispersion on x,y for all z above
level set..

It can't be this simple.

ðŸ¤” Black box func is a problem.

Then.. sample, in 3d project onto z-plane, calc dispersion,
lower/higher z according to lower/higher dispersion ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” ?

"@_pem_pem

it is truly amazing that capitalism is so weak that a few weeks of
sustained absence of labor is enough to make it entirely
collapse. [T]he rich are powerful in a way, but in another way, we now
know exactly how easy it is to ruin all of their lives permanently"

"@DavidSegalRI

The let-them-die push comes after just one week of hanging out at
home. If we did this for another 6 or 7 weeks and then went back to
work as normal, the average American would still finish the year
having worked around as many hours as Germans work in an *typical*
year"

Why is global opt done in such haphazard fashion? Think 3d, I can have
z plane cut f at any level and I bet I could calc the area of level
set enclosed points. Move the plane up-down to find place where area
is near zero which will be at global minimum?

"@davidsirota

Pundits & politicians in the world's richest nation are now
mainstreaming the idea of sending people back to work during a lethal
pandemic with no guaranteed paid sick days, no guaranteed health care
and no guaranteed access to protective gear. What stage of feudalism
is this?"
