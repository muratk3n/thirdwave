When I was 16 I was running home after getting off the subway cause I
was late for curfew. A group of cops stopped me, threw me against the
wall so hard that it bruised my face. Made fun of me for being poor
when they saw my shitty wallet. Not first or last time

"Rome was experiencing the harsh realities imposed by the laws of
thermodynamics. Maintaining its infrastructure and population in a
non-equilibrium state required large amounts of energy. Its energy
regime, however, was becoming exhausted. With no other alternative
sources of energy available, Rome put even more pressure on its
dwindling energy legacy. By the fifth century, the size of the
government and military bureaucracy had doubled. To pay for it, taxes
were increased, further impoverishing the population, especially the
dwindling farm population. The empire, writes Joseph Tainter, began
consuming its own capital in the form of ‚Äúproducing lands and peasant
populations.‚Äù

Weakened by a depleted energy regime, the empire began to
crumble. Basic services dwindled. The immense Roman infrastructure
fell into disrepair. The military could no longer hold marauding
invaders at bay. Barbarian hordes began to whittle away at the
decaying Roman Empire, at first in distant lands. By the sixth
century, the invaders were at the gates of Rome. The great Roman
Empire had collapsed. By the sixth century, the population of Rome,
once numbering more than 1,000,000, had shrunk to less than 30,000
inhabitants. The city itself was reduced nearly to rubble, a stark
reminder of how unforgiving the energy laws are.

The [damage] was enormous. The available free [resources] of the
Mediterranean, North Africa, and large parts of Continental Europe,
reaching as far north as Spain and England, had been sucked into the
Roman machine. Deforested land, eroded soil, and impoverished and
diseased human populations lay scattered across the empire. Europe
would not recover for another 600 years"

Some "civilizations"

Later in history, our forebears captured and ‚Äúharnessed‚Äù one another
as energy-producing power plants‚Äîa process that continued apace until
the latter part of the 19th century‚Äîand used human slavery as a means
to increase energy flow. Slave labor built the great pyramids of
Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and the ceremonial shrines of the
Mayan and Teotihuacan civilizations in the Americas. The Great Wall in
China required the labor of more than a million slaves, half of whom
perished in the effort.12 Nearly 20 percent of the population of Rome
in the first few centuries A.D. were slaves.

"Plant cultivation‚Äîaided by irrigation systems‚Äîgreatly increased the
yield per unit of human energy or labor expended. Agricultural
surpluses also freed at least some people from toil on the
land. Freeing people from labor created the beginnings of a social
hierarchy and the differentiation of tasks. Priest and warrior classes
slowly emerged, as did an artisan class somewhat later on. The
differentiation and specialization of tasks spawned new, more complex
institutional arrangements"

No. Rituals don't create culture. Culture has to do with codes,
embedded in emotional brain which are transmitted through osmosis, and
they effect *decisions*. Putting a funky hat on, playing with some
beads, mumbling some nonsense is not culture.

Exactly - where you are born matters. She is French. People who tell
her otherwise need to shut the fonk up, and she should remind them of
that.

Parents - stop telling children abt their "home country". They ain't
you, they'll never be you. You made that decision for them when you
moved your punk ass to where you are now from your (very likely)
shithole country. They won't belong to your original homeland just for
the virtue of being your children.

Below is oil production data for the world and Libya. Since 2011
Libyan civil war their production was hammered, but world production
went upwards, unscatched. Clearly someone picked up the slack and that
someone else benefited.

When it comes to oil chicanery, "taking the oil" may not be the only
game in town. "Denying the oil to someone else", "crippling oil
production somewhere so somewhere else can produce more" are probably
all in the playbook.

A side effect to the such is public sphere overcrowding with drama
queens. Lowest hanging fruit, one-step solutions are tried
already. The remaining ones are moronic and intractable, so it takes a
lot of energy and drama to mobilize towards them. Then there is drama
afterwards when things invariably fail because the direction was dumb
in the first place.

All that could be avoided with a little foresight. Not much, just a
little.

Most of the stuff I advocate is nothing special - but I try to take
two steps instead of one.

Taking one step from the established understanding of QM takes you to
all the chaos we see on TV, ppl running around confused, going back,
forward in time, space. If we take one step in Einstein's direction,
then take another towards QM as approximation, the rest makes more
sense.

Or popular view on energy says 'I have batteries on laptop duuude,
wanna put it in my car'. Better is generate clean fuel (step 1), then
next step put it in the car (step 2). Two very simple steps, that
require some upfront investment sure, but doable.

We are stuck, on a lot of fronts. I don't think a single one step, as
"courageous" it might seem, will provide any more Earth shattering
solutions. No more superhero-ish, cult leaders. Just boring, able
people trying to lay groundwork for two steps ahead.
