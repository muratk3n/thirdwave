"@BCAppelbaum

Americans have the right to gather and protest. The police are paid
and empowered to protect our ability to exercise our rights. Instead,
night after night, many police departments are treating protesters as
enemies"

The race problems due to pol brutality and ppl wondering how to fix it
always reminds me that joke with patient going to doctor saying 'Doc
it hurts when I move my arm this way'. What does the doctor say?  Tho
flippant that's the answer.

Sirota: "Democrats‚Äô Cobra plan may secure insurance companies‚Äô profit-skimming
position between Americans and their healthcare providers for decades
to come. ...

Many of the self-styled progressive advocacy groups in Washington that
posture as #resistance leaders turned a blind eye to the bill‚Äôs
problems and endorsed the legislation shortly after it was introduced,
undercutting progressive lawmakers off the bat.

Making matters worse was the theater on the House floor. During the
debate over the Democratic bill, nine progressive lawmakers made a
public show of voting against the procedural measure to advance the
bill, along with a tiny group of moderates. When it came to the real
vote on actually passing the bill, a larger group of moderates ended
up voting against it, but only one progressive lawmaker,
Representative Pramila Jayapal, voted no. Had the progressives and
moderates combined forces on either of the votes, they would have
forced the bill back to the drawing board. Instead, their shenanigans
ultimately helped secure the legislation‚Äôs passage"

"@kthalps

The \#Russiagate narrative fosters brain worms, & anti-liberal group
think & reverence of 'intelligence community.' & it's weaponized to
cast suspicion on Black protestors. If you pushed the infantilizing
'Russians tricked Black people' narrative you helped do this
\#GeorgeFloyd"
