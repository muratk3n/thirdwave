Right pointing backhand index Some say reaction to CV is worse than CV (Bc Econ damage)

I get it, but remember, CV didn‚Äôt force: Down pointing backhand index

1. Mkt cap/gdp 150%+

2. Corp debt all time high

3. Consumer debt all time high

4. Dependency on ZIRP/QE

5. No savings

6. Econ built on debt+asset bubbles

CV is just a pin"

@lee_gsc

Warren's "excuse me????" moment here is so important. We can't afford to let Republicans gaslight the American people.

üòÜüòÜ I hope it works out 4 him, I really do. He is under the radar right
now and spotlight on DJT and no news from Biden is good news but this

"@matthewstoller

Just listening to the Senate floor. It's a line of Republican Senators
accusing Democrats of treason with an occasional Democratic Senator
sometimes giving a speech on how bipartisan everyone is being and
telling the GOP not to lose heart"

Bizarro land.

"@JohnDPMorgan

Lot of people seem determined to debunk hydroxychloroquine based on
Trump‚Äôs comments. This is a cognitive fallacy: ‚ÄúBad person says X
therefore X is wrong‚Äù. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Meanwhile hospitals are
incorporating HCQ into their protocols as fast as they can write them"
