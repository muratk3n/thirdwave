"The first submersible application of fuel cells is the German Type 212
submarine. Each Type 212 contains nine PEM fuel cells, spread
throughout the ship, providing between 30 kW and 50 kW each of
electrical power. This allows the Type 212 to remain submerged
longer and makes them more difficult to detect. Fuel cell powered
submarines are also easier to design, manufacture, and maintain than
nuclear-powered submarines"

Need to learn from the founders. While designing the system they
always had the worst-case scenario in mind.

"Barbara Boxer: DHS was a mistake. I regret voting for it.  I never
imagined a president like Trump when I voted to create the Department
of Homeland Security" --  washingtonpost.com

Nobodys that dumb. Not even the Army

Honeypot. Guaranteed.

"But I still cant believe that post was placed there intentionally. It
has to be a mistake"

Jake Tapper wrote the book on which *The Outpost* movie was based?
Not bad...

"@BenJealous

Suranne Jones, wonderful as the female Tardis.

Coalition mgmt as orchestra conducting, fine. As long as the horns get

"@davidsirota

For the most part, if you shill for corporate power, you‚Äôre never canceled for anything. If you challenge corporate power, you run the risk of being canceled for anything"

So it's all in the smell.. Where is the nonlinear regression (sorry,
"AI") model to replicate this? If there are smell sensors accurate
enough as dog's nose then the rest would be doable

BMW was undecided for a while but must have sensed the winds
changing. Or a kick in the pants from the DE gov

"@tixhonjm

BMW X5 hydrogen fuel cell version coming"

N. Patrick Harris is in the new Matrix?

Is this thing going to be a dark parody of the first three movies?
Like a *Starship Troopers* but for computer simulation.

---

They might have tried to pander little bit, bad guy attacks "the
East", which is behind a wall, their leader looks Asian, but it's good
action movie, which means it talks to something human. You can't lay
it on too thick and expect it to be a good movie.

"*Mortal Engines* (2018) looks a bit like CH propaganda"

That amt of lithium can destabilize countries (Bolivia?). This tech
needs to be buried. Not fit for use anything other than quick
buffering of energy, in small amounts.

Even if battery makers removed **all** cobalt, the remaining issue is
lithium. Then we have 8-15 kg vs 0.007 kg of rare earth usage. This is
not even a contest. The closer I look at this, the worse the BEV
option looks

"In general, lithium demand for BEVs is 8‚Äì15 kg Li for [typical]
