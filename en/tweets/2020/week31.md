technologies could become one of the defining business stories in the
global effort to stop climate change.

Scarred by its painful experience in solar¬†PV¬†manufacturing, which was
developed in Europe at high cost only to later move to China, Europe
is not taking any chances with hydrogen.

In a bid to outcompete China and fulfil its ambition to become
climate-neutral, Europe has launched a massive green hydrogen push to
decarbonise industry and aviation and secure promising export

"The formulation that slavery was tolerated as a necessary evil at the

is a fairly standard one, and mostly an accurate way of putting the

a plan; it just didn‚Äôt work out the way they expected"

And boy did the recent events prove his "paranoia" right.

Richard Stallman: "I am careful in how I connect to the
internet. Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial nonfree
Javascript code. I use LibreJS to prevent nonfree Javascript code from
running..

I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git) that
fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to me. Then I
look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy to see the text in
the HTML page directly. I usually try lynx first, then a graphical
browser if the page needs it"

Nice.. Github lists the computer languages used in your repo in percentage.
My tutorial repo has roughly,


TeX  71.0%
 
Python 12.2%
 
Java 11.1%
 
MATLAB 2.0%
 
Common Lisp 1.3%
 
JavaScript 0.3%


That's exactly right. TeX is high in the list, obviously, the whole
thing is written in LaTeX. Python is next up, the main language of all
computations. Java is from the sub-blog, the non-math, tech part. Some
my early AI posts are in Lisp, GH caught that. Very good.

"With between 20-45% of the diesel fuel being displaced by green
hydrogen on the various vehicles, the HyTIME project concluded that
with the appropriate hydrogen infrastructure, fleet wide roll-out
could provide a huge and timely step change in overall fleet
emissions"

The grid is inefficient as hell. De-electrification is needed.

\#disruptTheGrid

"I'm most interested in seeing how Bloom Energy can potentially solve
two problems at once with a new strategy. The company recently
announced a new solid oxide electrolyzer that it expects to have
available in 2021. In its simplest form, an electrolyzer simply uses
energy (usually electricity) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen
atoms. It's the reverse of the chemical reaction that takes place in a
fuel cell.

The reason electrolyzers are important for energy is that -- if
they're cost-effective -- they could essentially make fossil fuels
obsolete by creating clean, abundant fuel. Water is abundant, and
there's more than enough wind and solar energy to replace all fossil
fuels, so clean energy isn't a problem either. Bloom Energy plans to
use this fuel for its backup markets, but it could also be used in
large ships currently being developed by Samsung Heavy Industries and
Bloom Energy. This could disrupt shipping as well as the grid"

For decades, NY has kept cops‚Äô records secret. You couldn‚Äôt know an
officer‚Äôs history, or even they‚Äôve been displined. Police unions have
gotten a judge to stop NYC from releasing most of the docs But we have
the records too. And now, so do you"

*The Atlantic*: "The U.S. and China both offer different social and
governance models‚Äîone is generally free and open and the other is
authoritarian and closed. Each threatens the other, not necessarily
because of the foreign-policy choices the leaders make, but because of
what the governments are at their core. Beijing believes that the
freedom of the press, the internet, social media, NGOs, economic
interdependence, and exchange programs all have the potential to
undermine their regime. They are not wrong. Indeed, many Americans saw
this as a positive side effect of engagement. Many Americans rightly
understand that China‚Äôs authoritarian model has negative externalities
that threaten U.S. interests and freedoms. Tools of repression
domestically find their way overseas. Beijing seeks to censor all
criticism of its regime by coercing other governments, companies, and
individuals. It sucks up data on foreign citizens. It employs
mercantilist techniques to pursue dominance of new technologies. China
is actively seeking to eviscerate liberal norms around human rights,
anti-corruption, and freedom of speech. The regime interferes in
democracies to advance its interests. Neither side can accommodate the
other without compromising the essence of its system"

"The first submersible application of fuel cells is the German Type 212
submarine. Each Type 212 contains nine PEM fuel cells, spread
throughout the ship, providing between 30 kW and 50 kW each of
electrical power. This allows the Type 212 to remain submerged
longer and makes them more difficult to detect. Fuel cell powered
submarines are also easier to design, manufacture, and maintain than
nuclear-powered submarines"
