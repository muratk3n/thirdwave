"@Sulliedsubjects

When I was 16 I was running home after getting off the subway cause I
was late for curfew. A group of cops stopped me, threw me against the
wall so hard that it bruised my face. Made fun of me for being poor

"Maintaining [Rome's] infrastructure and population in a
non-equilibrium state [ruling over bunch ppl, centrally is inherently
unstable] required large amounts of energy. Its energy regime,
however, was becoming exhausted. With no other alternative sources of
energy available, Rome put even more pressure on its dwindling energy
legacy. By the fifth century, the size of the government and military
bureaucracy had doubled. To pay for it, taxes were increased, further
impoverishing the population, especially the dwindling farm
population. The empire, writes Joseph Tainter, began consuming its own
capital in the form of 'producing lands and peasant populations'.

Weakened by a depleted energy regime, the empire began to
crumble. Basic services dwindled. The immense Roman infrastructure
fell into disrepair. The military could no longer hold marauding
invaders at bay. Barbarian hordes began to whittle away at the
decaying Roman Empire, at first in distant lands. By the sixth
century, the invaders were at the gates of Rome. The great Roman
Empire had collapsed. By the sixth century, the population of Rome,
once numbering more than 1,000,000, had shrunk to less than 30,000
inhabitants. The city itself was reduced nearly to rubble, a stark
reminder of how unforgiving the energy laws are.

The [damage] was enormous. The available free [resources] of the
Mediterranean, North Africa, and large parts of Continental Europe,
reaching as far north as Spain and England, had been sucked into the
Roman machine. Deforested land, eroded soil, and impoverished and
diseased human populations lay scattered across the empire. Europe
would not recover for another 600 years"

Some "civilization"

Later in history, our forebears captured and 'harnessed' one another
as energy-producing power plants‚Äîa process that continued apace until
the latter part of the 19th century‚Äîand used human slavery as a means
to increase energy flow. Slave labor built the great pyramids of
Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and the ceremonial shrines of the
Mayan and Teotihuacan civilizations in the Americas. The Great Wall in
China required the labor of more than a million slaves, half of whom
perished in the effort.12 Nearly 20 percent of the population of Rome
in the first few centuries A.D. were slaves.

"Plant cultivation‚Äîaided by irrigation systems‚Äîgreatly increased the
yield per unit of human energy or labor expended. Agricultural
surpluses also freed at least some people from toil on the
land. Freeing people from labor created the beginnings of a social
hierarchy and the differentiation of tasks. Priest and warrior classes
slowly emerged, as did an artisan class somewhat later on. The
differentiation and specialization of tasks spawned new, more complex
institutional arrangements"

No. Rituals don't create culture. Culture has to do with codes,
embedded in emotional brain which are transmitted through osmosis, and
they effect *decisions*. Putting a funky hat on, playing with some
beads, mumbling some nonsense is not culture.

Exactly - where you are born matters. She is French. People who tell
her otherwise need to shut the fonk up, and she should remind them of
that.

Parents - stop telling children abt their "home country". They ain't
you, they'll never be you. You made that decision for them when you
moved your punk ass to where you are now from your (very likely)
shithole country. They won't belong to your original homeland just for
the virtue of being your children.

against everything else, incredibly useful), find who has the highest
neg value against Libya.

Below is oil production data for the world and Libya. Since 2011
Libyan civil war their production was hammered, but world production
went upwards, unscatched. Clearly someone picked up the slack and that
someone benefited.

When it comes to oil chicanery, "taking the oil" may not be the only
game in town. "Denying the oil to someone else", "crippling oil
production somewhere so somewhere else can produce more" are probably
all in the playbook.

A side effect to the such is public sphere overcrowding with drama
queens. Lowest hanging fruit, one-step solutions are tried
already. The remaining ones are moronic and intractable, so it takes a
lot of energy and drama to mobilize towards them. Then there is drama
afterwards when things invariably fail because the direction was dumb
in the first place.

All that could be avoided with a little foresight. Not much, just a
little.

Most of the stuff I advocate is nothing special - but I try to take
two steps instead of one.

Taking one step from the established understanding of QM takes you to
all the chaos we see on TV, ppl running around confused, going back,
forward in time, space. If we take one step in Einstein's direction,
then take another towards QM as approximation, the rest makes more
sense.

Or popular view on energy says 'I have batteries on laptop duuude,
wanna put it in my car'. Better is generate clean fuel (step 1), then
next step put it in the car (step 2). Two very simple steps, that
require some upfront investment sure, but doable.

We are stuck, on a lot of fronts. I don't think a single one step, as
"courageous" it might seem, will provide any more Earth shattering
solutions. No more superhero-ish, cult leaders. Just boring, able
people trying to lay groundwork for two steps ahead.

Instead of looking for f-ing universes in multiples, wouldn't it be
better to build upon "space-as-an-illusion" idea - a route already
hinted at by Einstein who showed space-time can bend? Take the next
step, show space is not primary but emergent, and show QM falls out of
this as an approximation.

But no, let's make a struggling actor's job harder.. Now not only do
they have to play the hero, but also the evil twin, in the same
episode from a different universe. This is exploitation. They are now
working double time, the goatee itches, and there is always that
annoying draft up the crack of your ass thanks to the leather pant
with the butt cut-out; an indispensible part of the evil twin
visual.

Right - if space is emergent, an illusion, that solves nonlocality of
entanglement. There is no "spooky action at a distance" because there
is no distance.

Smolin: "If locality is not absolute, if it is the contingent result
of dynamics, it will have defects and exceptions. And indeed, this
appears to be the case: how else are we to understand quantum
nonlocality, particularly nonlocal entanglement? These, I would
hypothesize, are remnants of the spaceless relations inherent in the
primordial stage, before space emerges"

*2020-2-10 19:7:37*

---

Smolin: "I drew a lesson from a survey of approaches to quantum
foundations, which is that space and time cannot both be
fundamental. Only one can be present at the deepest level of
understanding; the other must be emergent and contingent. This seems
ultimately to be forced on us by the nonlocality of entanglement,
which leads to a tension between realist approaches to quantum
mechanics and special relativity. The latter unifies space and time
into spacetime, which the experimental tests of Bell‚Äôs restriction
suggest is transcended in individual quantum processes. I would then
like to suggest that the tension is resolved by making one of the pair
space/time fundamental, while the other is an emergent and approximate
description, ultimately a kind of illusion. For many reasons, some
described here, some the subject of earlier books,1 I choose to focus
on the hypothesis that time is fundamental, while space is emergent."

Great. Now let's add the automagic-money-creation-per-user,
digital-basic-income feature so money base expands, everyone has money

Nano on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_\(cryptocurrency\)):
"Nano is a decentralized, open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency
released under the FreeBSD License. It facilitates feeless and
fast-settling transactions without intermediaries by utilizing a
distributed ledger. Nano‚Äôs goal is to address the scalability
limitations of Bitcoin, which can result in restrictive fees and
increased transaction confirmation times when under load. Unlike other
cryptocurrencies, Nano does not rely on mining or transaction fees,
and transactions typically confirm in 0.25-10 seconds.

The Nano protocol functions by employing a block-lattice data
structure, a unique implementation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
in addition to a voting-based consensus algorithm called Open
Representative Voting. Accounts on the Nano network each have their
own blockchain, which enables transactions to be quickly processed
asynchronously. The transactions are then voted on by user-selected
representative nodes before being immutably confirmed"
