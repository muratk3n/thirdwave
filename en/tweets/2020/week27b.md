*The Guardian*: "Hydrogen fuel bubbles up the agenda as investments
rocket. Governments and carmakers press on with hydrogen fuel cells to
power cars, buses, trains and even aircraft.

More than 50 years ago hydrogen fuel cells helped put Neil Armstrong
on the moon, but mainstream usage of the technology has remained
elusive since. Now there are signs that may be changing, with a spate
of new investments even amid the coronavirus pandemic"

Good good.. seeing more alternatives... One
[model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2822) makes QM as emergent, an
approximation, another re-drives gravity.

---

Erik V used to be a stringer, but quit it bcz it was going
nowhere. You don't need ST for emergent gravity, there are references
to a certain math used there that's it

---

Eric Verlinde: "Gravity has given many hints of being an emergent
phenomenon, yet up to this day it is still seen as a fundamental
force. The similarities with other known emergent phenomena, such as
thermodynamics and hydrodynamics, have been mostly regarded as just
suggestive analogies. It is time we not only notice the analogy, and
talk about the similarity, but finally do away with gravity as a
fundamental force.

Of course, Einstein’s geometric description of gravity is beautiful,
and in a certain way compelling. Geometry appeals to the visual part
of our minds, and is amazingly powerful in summarizing many aspects of
a physical problem. Presumably this explains why we, as a community,
have been so reluctant to give up the geometric formulation of gravity
as being fundamental. But it is inevitable we do so. If gravity is
emergent, so is space time geometry. Einstein tied these two concepts
together, and both have to be given up if we want to understand one or
the other at a more fundamental level"

This approach isn't abt [quantizing gravity](https://youtu.be/5foUTeRdqII?t=358)

---

There are two good things abt the Verlinde model now.. One, it has no
free parameters, two, it can explain dark matter (says it doesn't
exist, but explains why it is thought to be there).

His type of theory is called 'emergent gravity', he claims gravity
emerges from entropy and information. Like temparature is an emergent
property of particle interactions.

"@ryanshrout

[Range limit] is fundamentally the big problem with EV still. Range
anxiety is real, cold weather range sucks, and people that don’t think
that’s true are blinded by shiny objects.

If they chose to, fine; But if it turns out they are culturally so
different, and they are concentrated in a certain region, then local
governance..? In Germany south is Catholic, north is Protestan, and
guess what, local loc gov is strong. Conservatives of both regions
don't even compete against eachother. Con of south CSU and con north
CDU govern together if elected, during elections stay out of
eachother's way.

Not sure what TR minorities will do .. The only state response these
people ever saw was one authoritarian regime after another.

"You said US acceptance of subcultures makes their assimilation
easier. Do you want TR Kurds to assimilate?"
