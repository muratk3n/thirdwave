üòÜüòÜ Sounds pretty bad when u say it like that, but I wonder if it's
that scary. Liberal scaremongering?

"The New Trump App Is a Death Star of Fake News‚Äîand It Reaches More
People Than Daytime Cable News

President Trump‚Äôs campaign manager has called what he‚Äôs built a
‚Äújuggernaut‚Äù and is likening his digital infrastructure to a Death
Star. In reality, what he's built is a trap.

And users are encouraged by a points system to share all of this
content with their networks for real-world benefits such as discounts
on store merchandise or a picture with the president. The Trump App is
providing news, entertainment, and the dopamine rush of earning points
and acknowledgement. It‚Äôs Candy Crush, but for politics"

Gotta say this about Resistance Libs on Twitter: they are committed to
just tweeting & sneering at Medicare for All & progressives even as
thousands die in a pandemic. I thought they might change ‚Äî but their
commitment to partisan nihilism is astonishingly unwavering.

They even had a guy in jail during the bunker shows... Perfect modern
setup. Like Toffler [says](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2011/03/fundamentals-of-industrial-ideologies_15.html)

>Nor was it only energy and work that were concentrated. Writing in the
>British social science journal New Society, Stan Cohen has pointed out
>that, with minor exceptions, prior to industrialism "the poor were
>kept at home or with relatives; criminals were fined, whipped or
>banished from one settlement to another; the insane were kept in their
>families, or supported by the community, if they were poor." All these
>groups were, in short, dispersed throughout the community.
>
>Industrialism revolutionized the situation. The early nineteenth
>century, in fact, has been called the time of the Great
>Incarcerations‚Äîwhen criminals were rounded up and concentrated in
>prisons, the mentally ill rounded up and concentrated in "lunatic
>asylums," and children rounded up and concentrated in schools, exactly
>as workers were concentrated in factories.

The show *Lost* was abt hunter-gatherer life, the island is our "early
ideal". When the main characters left the island to go back to their
previous lives, outside, temporaril later in the series, they were
miserable.

But modernity was imposed on them once before in the island, when they
discovered that bunker. They obtained some creature comforts there,
could shover, shave and have readily available food, but they had to
press the stupid button. What is that like? Work!! Modernity!!
Bullshit job!

So if we could cut CO2 emissions in half we'd fix the problem (granted
we fix methane, and that freaky
[SF6](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/09/sf6.html)
thing).

Demirel, *Green Energy and Technology*: "The burning of fossil fuels
produces around 21.3 Gigatons of carbon dioxide per year, and natural
processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net
increase of 10.65 billion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year"
