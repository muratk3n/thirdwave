Why is the use of renewable fuel, even if produced from fossil,
preferable?

Easier enforcement.

Fossil fuel at the end-user can leak, emission more likely. Carmakers
can cheat (see the Volkswagen 2015 scandal).

But if gov encourages, enforces clean fuel production at the source,
even with CCS, or even better 100% clean production, then all the way
down the line, beginning, middle, the end, we know there can be no
leaks, no emissions. No need to police Volkswagen, or Honda, Toyota,
etc. their fuel-cell car will have no choice but be clean.

Panels in the Arctic Circle (north)..? Sure. 6 months of constant-daylight.

When dark, no problem, panels in the Antartic Circle (south). Go for
it.

Since we r not tied to below-ground resources, countries with sea
access near the equator cld create floating panel structures.

How much solar panel space would Saudi Arabia need to produce its
crude output's equiv energy,

Production is 9.01 million barrels / day (Nov 2020).

1 Barrel of oil is 136 kg. Energy density of crude oil 158.4 Kwh/kg.

Sun energy falling on Earth 1 kW/m2, 24 KWh/m2 in a day.

Panel efficiency 20%, sunlight availability 50% (highest for SA)

```python
solar_kwh_day_m2 = 24*0.20*0.50
oil_energy_day = 136 * 9.01 * 1e6 * 158.4
area = (oil_energy_day / solar_kwh_day_m2)
print ("area of %0.2f km^2" % (area / 1e6))
print ("square with one side %0.2f km" % (np.sqrt(area) / 1000.0))
```

```text
area of 80873.76 km^2
square with one side 284.38 km
```

An area 290 km x 290 km. of panels. SA Rub' al Khali desert is 650,000
km^2, 1/7th of that is needed approximately. It's not a small area,
sure, but not insane large, like Texas? If we are desparate, we might
see some unorthodox engineering.

Professionally as well whichever country made your career gets the

So there is no "brain drain" as is usually known, there is "raw brain

formed into a brain elsewhere.

Crazy. Elements of that concl must be stewing in head for >20 yrs. I
remember how Ozdemir writes he knows so many local (DE) stories, tales
intimately and knows no other ones from anywhere else in similar fashion.

---

In fact Cem Özdemir, the first parliementarian of "TR origin" in DE
partliament, wrote a book about precisely that, titled *Ich bin
Inländer* (I am Native). I read it during the 90s. This book was one
of many data points that contributed to this blog's
raised-in-country-is-culture conclusion rather than
assumed-or-given-identity-is-culture delusion.

He is a German of TR origin..

He went there at a very young age, and what does [culture code](2014/06/the-culture-code.md)

Reuters: "Toyota unveils new fuel cell car in fresh push on hydrogen technology"

---

Noted W was mentioned; big deal coming from a former oilman.

"Green hydrogen, an alternative fuel generated with clean energy, is
experiencing a global resurgence and has been identified as the clean
energy source that could help bring the world to net-zero emissions in
the coming decades.

It was initially touted in the U.S. during President George W. Bush's
first term, when it was nicknamed the "freedom fuel."

Now, President-elect Joe Biden is promising that the U.S. will be able
to access green hydrogen at the same cost as conventional hydrogen
within a decade as part of his clean energy plan. Several countries
around the world already invest heavily into it, including Chile,
Japan, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Australia"

Working with hair-splitting detail as programmer, is much more intense
than, say, in social sciences bcz at the end of the day programmatic
concepts, however abstract at first, need to *compile*, i.e. accepted
by a software compiler to be turned into machine code. So programmers
in some ways have compilers in their heads, that does strict
checks. Obviously every spoken language has also syntactic rules, but
none that can be verified instantly, to its tiniest comma, and can be
executed on-demand. So we run the compiler in our heads before
submitting code to the machine, we want to see as little errors as
possible, which makes it a stringent task. Do it a long time, you
really want to see that rapping dog at the end of the day. .

I watched docu on nuclear (fission) and fusion. Fusion sounds far off,
and I am not convinced fission's waste handling is handled properly,
and safety issue is ever-present.

Solar power is plenty, with incr panel efficiency (right now at 25%)
it'll get better. Add non-fracking fossil + CCS (at the source), for a
while, it can work.

---

Not all. Let's see... some net zero commitments are Sweden for 2045,
and United Kingdom, France, Denmark, New Zealand, Hungary for 2050.

Yes, Sweden, 39% is ☢️, France's 71% of electricity comes from ☢️. But
UK or Denmark dont have much of it.

"Most countries who commited to net-zero get their energy from
nuclear"

At the end of the day, by and large, Feynman did science to compute
stuff. He liked doing that, and I believe this is the right attitude
to have, in general, even for ppl who are deep in the weeds of
theory. The attitude also jels well with the beginning of modern
science, Newton was an active computer.

Rapaport: "[B]oth solids and gases have well-developed theoretical
foundations, but there is no general theory of liquids. For solids,
theory begins by assuming that the atomic constituents undergo small
oscillations about fixed lattice positions; for gases, independent
atoms are assumed and interactions are introduced as weak
perturbations. In the case of liquids, however, the interactions are
as important as in the solid state, but there is no underlying ordered
structure to begin with"
