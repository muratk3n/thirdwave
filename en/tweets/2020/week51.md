Reuters: "Toyota unveils new fuel cell car in fresh push on hydrogen technology"

---

Noted W was mentioned; big deal coming from a former oilman.

"Green hydrogen, an alternative fuel generated with clean energy, is
experiencing a global resurgence and has been identified as the clean
energy source that could help bring the world to net-zero emissions in
the coming decades.

It was initially touted in the U.S. during President George W. Bush's
first term, when it was nicknamed the "freedom fuel."

Now, President-elect Joe Biden is promising that the U.S. will be able
to access green hydrogen at the same cost as conventional hydrogen
within a decade as part of his clean energy plan. Several countries
around the world already invest heavily into it, including Chile,
Japan, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Australia"

Working with hair-splitting detail as programmer, is much more intense
than, say, in social sciences bcz at the end of the day programmatic
concepts, however abstract at first, need to *compile*, i.e. accepted
by a software compiler to be turned into machine code. So programmers
in some ways have compilers in their heads, that does strict
checks. Obviously every spoken language has also syntactic rules, but
none that can be verified instantly, to its tiniest comma, and can be
executed on-demand. So we run the compiler in our heads before
submitting code to the machine, we want to see as little errors as
possible, which makes it a stringent task. Do it a long time, you
really want to see that rapping dog at the end of the day. .

There were a lot of surprises in 2020, but I'd put the vastly reduced
salience of immigration in this election v. '18 and '20 on the
list. Immigration wasn't even mentioned in the first debate, and the
exit poll didn't bother to ask about it, either"

Yea I saw daily intake req for 1000 mg which is crazy. Youd have to
sit and eat yogurt, eggs all day.

"Do we really need all that calcium? ... The tide started to turn in
2005 when results from two British studies showed that calcium didn't
prevent fractures ‚Äî even when taken in combination with vitamin
D. [another research] showed that postmenopausal women who took a
calcium‚Äìvitamin D combination were no less likely to break their hip
than women who took a placebo pill"

I watched docu on nuclear (fission) and fusion. Fusion sounds far off,
and I am not convinced fission's waste handling is handled properly,
and safety issue is ever-present.

Solar power is plenty, with incr panel efficiency (right now at 25%)
it'll get better. Add non-fracking fossil + CCS (at the source), for a
while, it can work.

Not all. Let's see... some net zero commitments are Sweden for 2045,
and United Kingdom, France, Denmark, New Zealand, Hungary for 2050.

Yes, Sweden, 39% is ‚ò¢Ô∏è, France's 71% of electricity comes from ‚ò¢Ô∏è. But
UK or Denmark dont have much of it.

"Most countries who commited to net-zero get their energy from
nuclear"

At the end of the day, by and large, Feynman did science to compute
stuff. He liked doing that, and I believe this is the right attitude
to have, in general, even for ppl who are deep in the weeds of
theory. The attitude also jels well with the beginning of modern
science, Newton was an active computer.

BTW Morales, who did some good things in his country, also f--d up in
a way.. he went to referandum for term extension, lost, had their SC
to overturn it, then won the general election. Turns out there was no
fraud in either, but at that point there was a general "funkyness" in
the air, and ppl could make that case... The left needs to be careful
with this stuff. He should have stepped down, give the reins to the
next guy. And guess what, after bunch of unnecessary drama that is
exactly what happened.

A lot of humor shared here is the kind tech types decompress with;
after paying attn to hair splitting detail for an extended period of
time, something like a rapping [dog](https://youtu.be/0ZUHqH4rDTg?t=17) becomes hilarious.

*Riddick* 2013, such a gutsy movie. Who would bet an entire movie on
an opening sequence with a guy trying to survive on a desolate planet?
Its basically this guy and his dog, at first.. that's it. Fantastic.

Rapaport: "[B]oth solids and gases have well-developed theoretical
foundations, but there is no general theory of liquids. For solids,
theory begins by assuming that the atomic constituents undergo small
oscillations about fixed lattice positions; for gases, independent
atoms are assumed and interactions are introduced as weak
perturbations. In the case of liquids, however, the interactions are
as important as in the solid state, but there is no underlying ordered
structure to begin with"
