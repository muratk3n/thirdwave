"@Hypat1aYu

The only reason why I didnâ€™t find out I loved programming until midway
through grad school was because I was too afraid to mess up my gpa to
take a computer science class... cuz the bell shaped curve really
penalizes risk taking and experimentation"

Damn. Slave owners demanded one last harvest before emancipation,
Juneteenth.

HAYEK vs PSEUDOLIBERTARIANS For those invoking "libertarianism" in
front of natural calamities, some news for you: Hayek explicitly gives
a role to the "state": protection against violence, epidemics, and
natural disasters. Namely; TAIL RISKS"

"@skdh

Here is something that should worry you. Each time I give a public
lecture people come up to me and say they agree with me that building
a bigger collider is currently a nonsense idea. It's a huge investment
with little scientific benefit and basically no societal relevance

I mostly get this from physicists of other disciplines (condensed
matter physicists seem to feature prominently, but maybe just because
there are many of them) but also from particle physicists who have
left the field, both theoreticians and experimentalists 

Yet, there is not a single one of them on the public record willing to
speak out. The reason I keep getting quoted by newspapers and
magazines is simply THAT THEY CAN'T FIND ANYONE ELSE WILLING TO SPEAK
OUT.

Not much; Markowitz model has $R^2$ 90% , conf intervals on the
[prediction](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2015/04/predicting-2016-presidential-election.html)
are usually tight.

It's funny among the three variables only one variable requires human
judgement. All others can simply be observed. Econ effect; voter knows
whether he is richer or poorer. Incumbency for >1 terms or not; that
is a fact. This leaves popularity of the incumbent, the only thing
where a judgement is applied. It works bcz the measure is coarse
(individuals judgement will have errors, normally distributed which
can be [corrected](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2020/07/crowd-wisdom.html)
through an average).

Elections are a vote on the incumbent, on three [broad parameters](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2015/04/predicting-2016-presidential-election.html).

Ebola to Zika to Measles, each facing its own set of obstacles. I'm
used to outbreaks being politicized but I've never witnessed this
amount of stupidity that has plagued this pandemic from the get-go by
electeds"
