‚ÄòRight Out of the Russian Playbook‚Äô"

It's unbelievable how much crit Black Lives Matter slogan gets. It's
clear what it is trying to say. I see variations with "All Lives",
"White Lives", "Buildings". I guess it's a sign of the slogan's
success. But I have to say I do think less of people who play games
with this thing.

Who says this was a "working class revolt"? Who gives a shit if it is
or isn't. Does it make the response less or more valid? Con is up in
arms but clearly something needs to change. So pretty please, with
hammer/sickle, macpro, sugar on top... Clean your fucking backyard.

At its height even with the threat of a nuke war Soviets came across,
and were, rational. That probably helped avert nuke war more than
anything.. If one side does not think the enem is rational, a jackass,
they cld take diff steps to prevent something.

No it's not a generational thing... Half-brained dit "narrativizing"
where there isn't one. "Imma write this deep thing now, bcz, like,
that's how I saw smart people do it".

There's a fine line with these provoc articles. That John Bolton
article "To Stop Iranian Bomb, Bomb Iran" might have been
palatable-ish bcz the urgency was not as high and everyone knew
Mustache was a warmonger. Cotton thing in the middle of this mayhem is
a wrong choice, in terms of timing which naturally caused reader
backlash. NYT miscalculated. Obviously free to publish whatever eff
they want. Cotton is wrong IMO, another matter.

"@kareem_carr

I went on a work outing to the movies once. All my white coworkers
wanted to sneak food in. I told them we'd get searched. Searched? They
had no idea what I was talking about. Halfway through the
conversation, we silently realized the issue. They were white and I
was black"

"@ProudSocialist

Store owners are speaking out and saying they will no longer call the
police because they don‚Äôt trust the police to show up without
murdering unarmed black people. If that doesn‚Äôt wake you up to how
racist and broken policing in America is then nothing will"
