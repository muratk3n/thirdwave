Gelman: "Overall, the new [Updated Santa Clara coronavirus report] is
stronger than the old, because it includes more data summaries and
more evidence regarding the all-important specificity number."

The math looks tight -
[PDF](https://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/79576.pdf). I
would forgo the analytic solutions just solve everything
numerically. Data ref would be nice.

Muller-Plantenberg: "[Researchers found that ] a small set of
variables‚Äìincluding the current account as a percentage of GDP, export
growth, international reserves and short-term foreign debt relative to
reserves‚Äìdo a very good job in predicting the EMS crisis in 1992‚Äì1993,
the Mexican crisis in 1994‚Äì1995 as well as the Asian crisis in 1997"

Effin Russkies. We all know it, there is this sheer mental rawpower
coming out of RU, it is a joke almost in science circles. Boyd from
Stanford was talking about a new area, says 'one day someone will find
a result for it..' then says 'and I bet that person will be a Russian'
half-jokingly and laughs. It's true. Is it the extreme cold..? Nothing
else to do, either drink vodka or think about stuff.

"St Petersburg University students develop a hydrogen fuel cell ..

‚ÄòThe most important thing for a catalyst is that it should not be very
expensive and should have a high power output per square
centimetre. You can increase this useful surface through porosity,‚Äô
explains Stepan Danilov. ‚ÄòKnowing this, we used nanostructured
nickel. It resembles Raney nickel, but we managed to make the material
even more porous. In order to further increase the activity of the
catalyst, we introduced platinum nano points into it - they are so
small that they have little or no effect on the cost of the fuel
cell. This allows our project to compete with lithium-ion batteries in
terms of price and performance.

The hydrogen fuel cell prototypes for quadrotors last two to three
times longer due to their higher capacity. While the operating
temperature of lithium-ion batteries ranges from minus 20 ¬∞C to plus
60 ¬∞C, the hydrogen fuel cells developed by the Hydrogen Express team
have a much larger operating temperature range ‚Äì from minus 60 ¬∞C to
plus 80 ¬∞C.

According to the team members, modern hydrogen fuel cells are quite
comparable in terms of safety with internal combustion engines, but
unlike them and lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells do not harm
the environment"

New PMI is [out](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#pmi),
major fall,

```
2020-03-01    49.1
2020-04-01    41.5
```

Anything below 50 is bad. 

Since Manuf PMI is a [leading
indicator](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#gdpism)
of GDP, expect that to fall further as well. So that red line will
follow that blue line. Then it is ka-booom.

"@Jkylebass

This is happening all over the globe. China threatened to withhold
medicine to the US for the Wuhan Virus naming convention. They
threatened Europe with the same for demanding an investigation into
origins and actions of the virus.  Now, they threaten on changing
office name ?

'China threatens to halt medical supplies after Netherlands changes
Taiwan rep office name'"
