# Week 49

Jobs in a renewable fuel economy? Of course there will be jobs... I
dont personally give a flying flap about full employment, only that
people have money and health insurance (not the same thing), but a 10
TRILLION $ worth green economy would imply a lot of jobs.. How can
economic activity that large involving a physical product not generate
jobs?

Due to their handling of covid some of the "magic" around China's
"good governance" story started to wear off.  They acted in childish
ways, and showed the world that a country who is not accountable to
their citizens, through some kind of ballot / electoral process can
actually be a danger to the entire community of nations.. The freak
experiment that is their system needs to end, at the very least,
evolve drastically.

That's probably the message aimed at too; coalition management.

me"

EM is a good guy. Strong H2 supporter.

"[Former Obama Energy Secretary Ernest] Moniz was the featured speaker
at the inaugural session of the Stanford University Global Energy
Dialogues on June 9. In a wide-ranging discussion covering the breadth
of energy resources needed to meet our climate challenge, he said that
renewables like wind and solar will be 'critical components.' However,
we also need 'an assault across the board on all approaches,'
including longer-term storage, hydrogen, carbon capture and
sequestration, even technologies that remove carbon from the
atmosphere"

Tanden? Dont know much abt, but the impression I got from others in

IMO, it is not a coincidence that they are putting Neera Tanden -- the
single biggest, most aggressive Bernie Sanders critic in the United
States of America -- specifically at OMB while Sanders is Senate
Budget Committee ranking/chair"

It's funny, these dictator types really arent that informed, bright;
Hitler had no idea what other leaders were truly thinking, their
motives.

Stalin did little better, he was had, but only for a while, figured
out Adolf early enough.

We cannot blame politicians who went along with Russiagate. It was too
easy of a narrative for the Dems, a unifier of sorts so it was
followed, pandered to. The onus and the criticism should go to / be on
the media; they chose to perpetuate the convenient lie. Politicians
live in the backdrop where MSM looms large.

NYT: "One of the great successes of the Republican Party in recent
decades is the relentless propagation of a simple formula for economic
growth: tax cuts.

The formula doesn’t work, but that has not affected its popularity. In
part, that’s because people like tax cuts ... It was in the context of
this worldview that it became popular to argue that tax cuts would
drive prosperity. Rich people would invest, productivity would
increase, wages would rise.

In the real world, things are more complicated. Wages are influenced
by a tug of war between employers and workers, and employers have been
winning. One clear piece of evidence is the yawning divergence between
productivity growth and wage growth since roughly 1970. Productivity
has more than doubled; wages have lagged far behind.

The point is not that economists were completely wrong. Productivity
obviously plays a role in determining wages. McDonald’s cannot pay
workers more money than it collects from its customers. But economists
were partly and consequentially wrong. Power mattered, too"

"Blows my mind" = "this is an awesome way of teaching and I'd love to
learn that way". And since microprocessor design is one of the hardest
subjects to teach, if it can be taught like this, we can teach
everything using the same method. No teachers required.

For many years China, a non-democracy, had high level support in US
policy circles, so CH becomes dollar-rich. Then US movies wanted a
piece of that muneeee, but u have to go through the CH censors and
appeal to a different crowd. Ergo movies get a bunch of artificially
planted CH characters, in the *The Meg*, *Independence Day 2*, even
some in *Avengers*. These actors are not there bcz they fit the
storytelling, they are plants which pulls down the quality of your
art. This is nearly as bad, possibly worse, than SJW art.

You need vitamins (from veg or fruit). Sailors on long treks would get
gum disease from meat only diets. All food storage mthds from all
cultures have a place for fruits for this reason. American Indian
