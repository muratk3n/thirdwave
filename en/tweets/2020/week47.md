So tired of hearing Pfizer didnâ€™t get money from the Fedâ€™s when they
got a 1.95 Billion [dollar] 'advance purchase' agreement. Soooo, yes
they damn well did get federal funding and because they had $2bn of
free cash they could go nuts on R&D knowing they already pre-sold 100m
doses"

Not sure whether RCEP is good or bad for the respective middle-classes
of all those RCEP countries, but the exclusion of US is strategically
significant.

Perfect timing too with US being in a funk.

US of course pulled out of the TPP with Trump in 2017.

---

US excluded!

China-backed RCEP deal excludes the US and will account for 30 percent
of the worldâ€™s economy and population"

I can see how some HKers can fall into "expat nationalism". HK folk
aren't exactly expats (from the mainland) in the usual sense but some
could see themselves that way. And a lot of expats overseas who "left
the country and always plan to come back one day" do confuse their
nostalgia with analysis, since they dont live in the "home country"
either, they do not see all that's going on inside, so develop a blind
romantic attachment. Could be the issue here.

People dont like Jackie Chan anymore in Hong Kong? I was wondering abt
that, JC's bio sounded like he could devolve into a Ch nationalism,
and apparently he did.

"Trump [has] largely achieved their goal of choking off the flow of
unauthorized immigrants into the United States â€” especially families
from Central America, many of whom come with the intention of
requesting asylum. ....

But the coronavirus has given the U.S. its most robust tool yet for
repelling asylum-seekers. An order signed by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in March ...  prohibited the entry of
unauthorized immigrants from Mexico in the name of public health. The
order gave border agents the authority to simply expel them. In the
months since, 200,000 migrants have been expelled, either to Mexico or
to their home countries. None have been given the opportunity to
request asylum or explain why they believed they would be persecuted
if they returned to their homelands.

The combination of international agreements, health concerns and new
tactics has effectively shut the border. So far, none of the elements
in the administrationâ€™s new 'waterproof fabric' have been overturned
in court or become the subject of public uproar, as family separation
did in 2018"

Theo James is a good lead. *How It Ends* was a perfectly watchable

That's wild.

I can see how such a carrier would be sub (!) optimal, every ounce of
air in a sub is bought with a certain weight penalty; but I appreciate
the attempt. Creative.

"But almost everyone appears to agree on one thing. In some way or
other, space-time itself seems to fall apart at a black hole, implying
that space-time is not the root level of reality, but an emergent
structure from something deeper. Although Einstein conceived of
gravity as the geometry of space-time, his theory also entails the
dissolution of space-time, which is ultimately why information can
escape its gravitational prison"

This is purely anecdotal, and I don't want to jinx it, but I don't
think I've ever in my life gone this long without getting a cold. I
haven't been sick once this year. Maybe we should have been wearing
masks all along"

Nearly all upcoming action movie trailers suck. Even the Ryan Reynolds
movie looks better.
