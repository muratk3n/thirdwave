A lot of politics in this song... 

"‚ô™‚ô¨ Now I'm stocking shirts in the Wal-Mart store ‚ô™

‚ô™‚ô¨ Just like the ones we made before

‚ô™ 'Cept this one came from Singapore

‚ô¨ I guess we can't make it here anymore

‚ô™‚ô¨ Should I hate a people for the shade of their skin

‚ô¨ Or the shape of their eyes or the shape I'm in

‚ô™‚ô¨ Should I hate 'em for having our jobs today

‚ô™‚ô¨ No I hate the men sent the jobs away"

She sounds like a closer.

AOC: "But we also learned that progressive policies do not hurt
candidates. Every single candidate that co-sponsored Medicare for All
in a swing district kept their seat.  ... If you‚Äôre not door-knocking,
if you‚Äôre not on the internet, if your main points of reliance are TV
and mail, then you‚Äôre not running a campaign on all cylinders. I just
don‚Äôt see how anyone could be making ideological claims when they
didn‚Äôt run a full-fledged campaign"

"In two new studies, researchers have used microwaves to produce
hydrogen from plastic waste and water, respectively. ... 

In the new process, the researchers pulverize plastic in a kitchen
blender, mix it with a catalyst made of iron oxide and aluminum oxide,
and then zap it with microwaves at 1000 Watts. The microwaves trigger
the catalyst particles to strip over 97 percent of the hydrogen from
plastic in seconds ...

[For water the] technique involves blasting a ceramic oxide with
microwaves, which removes oxygen from the material and increases its
electrical conductivity. The activated ceramic material then
spontaneously reacts with water that is passed over it, forming
hydrogen and oxygen, which reoxygenates the ceramic so it can be
reused.

Not sure whether RCEP is good or bad for the respective middle-classes
of all those RCEP countries, but the exclusion of US is strategically
significant.

Perfect timing too with US being in a funk.

US of course pulled out of the TPP with Trump in 2017.

US excluded!

I can see how some HKers can fall into "expat nationalism". HK folk
aren't exactly expats (from the mainland) in the usual sense but some
could see themselves that way. And a lot of expats overseas who "left
the country and always plan to come back one day" do confuse their
nostalgia with analysis, since they dont live in the "home country"
either, they do not see all that's going on inside, so develop a blind
romantic attachment. Could be the issue here.

"Trump [has] largely achieved their goal of choking off the flow of
unauthorized immigrants into the United States ‚Äî especially families
from Central America, many of whom come with the intention of
requesting asylum. ....

But the coronavirus has given the U.S. its most robust tool yet for
repelling asylum-seekers. An order signed by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in March ...  prohibited the entry of
unauthorized immigrants from Mexico in the name of public health. The
order gave border agents the authority to simply expel them. In the
months since, 200,000 migrants have been expelled, either to Mexico or
to their home countries. None have been given the opportunity to
request asylum or explain why they believed they would be persecuted
if they returned to their homelands.

The combination of international agreements, health concerns and new
tactics has effectively shut the border. So far, none of the elements
in the administration‚Äôs new 'waterproof fabric' have been overturned
in court or become the subject of public uproar, as family separation
did in 2018"

"But almost everyone appears to agree on one thing. In some way or
other, space-time itself seems to fall apart at a black hole, implying
that space-time is not the root level of reality, but an emergent
structure from something deeper. Although Einstein conceived of
gravity as the geometry of space-time, his theory also entails the
dissolution of space-time, which is ultimately why information can
escape its gravitational prison"
