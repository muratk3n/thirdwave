Peasants didn't 'bargain for better pay and conditions' after the

BEVs - what a moronic f-ing tech.. Unbelievable it even came this far.

"Earlier this year, BMW announced the next generation of its hydrogen
fuel cell drivetrain, and casually mentioned that real world tests
would begin in the next couple of years.

For those drivers, hydrogen cars could be the easy answer, as fueling
is pretty. In the UK, industry bodies estimate that some 40% of
households don’t have access to off-street parking to charge EVs.

For those drivers, hydrogen cars could be the easy answer as fueling
is pretty much the exact same process as for a gasoline car"

COV: 178K in 2 days. Daily % change down to 2.33. Some reports
indicated Germany R is up to 1 - this is not true.

US turned blue - sorry bout that, I am running out of shades of red,
sadly, so had to switch to something new.

Russia has offloaded the management of HTS to Ankara, a cost free

the pickle Ankara now finds itself in"

"@zacharylipton

A relative's acct got hacked on Facebook today. Just 2-3 messages
(trying to seem innocuous) left me 99.9% sure the account was
cracked. Googled the message =>corroborating it's a known scam =>damn
near 100% sure. Super simple reasoning yet strangely beyond what ML
does reliably"
