Real change happens top-down, not bottom-up.

Top, bottom are a bit misleading words though.. Your dentist is not
your superior bcz he knows dentistry better than you.

People revolt, react -- they are not policy experts, this is what they
do. Sure their anger can push leadership, but that's kind of late at
that point isn't it? Isn't the point of political leadership that
things do not get there in the first place? Revolt indicates failure
of politics.

"@garrygolden

Battery-only EV crowd is misreading why H2 Fuel Cells will win over
OEMs for heavy duty AND passenger. FC upsides;: cost per mass; less
risky/simpler supply chains; building out H2 refueling at scale is
cheaper than costs of grid balancing and extending wires"

Being "tough on crime". Sounded so great on paper and on TV back in
the day esp when u delivered it with a half open-mouth "IT person",
second-rate channeling of R. Redford, but did these "tough" policies
work? Were their potential side effects thought through?
