Same report: "Based on current processes .. seawater reverse osmosis
(SWRO) 60% at 3.5 Kilowatt hours per cubic meter (kWhm-3) and
thermally driven processes 40% at 17 kWhm-3, the total desalination
energy consumption .... with the projected expansion of desalination
capacities, the energy consumption .. is expected to reach to 2.4
Gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2030 as compared to only 1.4 GWh in 2018"

So true. Yet I see some teachers even in ORMS brush such details under
the carpet. How can u not show where $A$ comes from? The whole problem
is encoded in it. I don't want to see some freak preprocessing code
and an obtuse API call. Show me the $A$!

Sounds like the String Theory of its day.

"@johncarlosbaez

Kelvin became fascinated by the theory of vortex atoms, studying the
stability of vortex rings.

Kelvin (= Thomson) argued that vortex rings were a better theory than
the main alternative: atoms as infinitely hard balls, made of... what?

He started calculating the vibrational modes of vortex rings, hoping
they could explain atomic spectra!

For a while, in the late 1800s, you could get a job at a British
university studying vortex atoms.  The subject was never very popular
outside the UK.

The models got more complex, and nobody ever succeeded in matching the
properties of actual atoms.

Eventually Kelvin gave up on vortex atoms... but didn't admit it
publicly.

In an 1896 talk FitzGerald, another expert on vortex atoms, recognized
the problems - but argued that it was "almost impossible" to falsify
the theory, because it was so flexible"

I didn't mean to but now I know two different ways of looking at the
assignment problem, and three different computational methods to solve
it.

Haha.. there is some good stuff there.. My fav is the DS9 one, excerpt below

"How Science Fiction Imagined the 2020s

The first episode opens with a transporter error that sends three crew
members back in time to 2024 San Francisco. Two characters are
promptly arrested for being homeless and dumped in a ‚Äúsanctuary zone,‚Äù
a walled inner-city internment camp for those unable to find work. The
third crew member conversely has the good fortune to be found by a
literal tech billionaire who made his fortune running media platforms
on the internet ‚Äî sorry, ‚Äúthe interface‚Äù ‚Äî and government data-mining
contracts. The story takes an even more radical and political turn
when the characters realize they have to ensure that a riot happens in
the sanctuary zone, thus triggering political events that will give
rise to the Federation"

Yes I've heard of some cases where the unemployed refused job offer
bcz they did not want to lose their unemployment checks. Some. But
Imma use this opp to stress the need for UBI anyway; With UBI ppl wld
never be in fear of losing money if employed, whatever employer pays
increases worker's already existing income by that much. Win win.

AKE FTW

"Ashai Kasei Engineering received an order for its 10MW large alkaline
water electrolysis system from Toshiba Energy Systems Corporation and
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO).

'This water electrolysis system is one of the largest in the world as
a stack size and can produce and supply 1,200Nm3 of hydrogen (at rated
operation) per hour,' Ashai Kasei said.

'After launching this water electrolysis system in November 2019, as a
result of conducting various tests, we were able to confirm hydrogen
quality that meets the required level'".
