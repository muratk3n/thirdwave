# Tweets - Week 12c

Free-market Reps never liked this shit anyway, it distorts
prices.. Prog left didn't like it bcz it enriched CEOs, the top 1%.
SB canceling could also deny a line of attack on DJT during the
general. Good politics.

The US Govt is able to sustain this #economy using extreme measures, but it has to come to the table like a distressed investor. Demand good collateral and warrants for the upside once this crisis passes.

Seeing more teachers putting up online lectures is great. This needs
to be the norm from now on, but content is worked on offline,
beforehand, and always available. No more wait for a content release.
Every last vestige of synchronization should be removed from the
system. No need for "immediate connection" with students, they wait
for nothing, teachers don't rush, 'the lecture' is always on.

Some teachers might have an issue with that especially if they have a
personality defect whereby through "standing up and delivering" in
front of others they get their identity confirmed. We shouldnt create
a whole bloody system around their deficiencies. A "consultant" for
questions here and there is very different from creator / performer /
grader of all things.
