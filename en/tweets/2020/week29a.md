The mask culture war has got to be one of the dumbest and most
destructive political/cultural disputes in modern American political
history. And we're continuing to pay the price"

Caitlin Johnstone: "And that‚Äôs why liberals hate the true left: because
leftists are a constant reminder that liberals aren‚Äôt what they
pretend to be. That they are just conservatives wearing a fake plastic
mask of justice and sanity"

Yesterday, the amount of land the Federal government officially
recognized as Indian Country--as under the jurisdiction of tribes--was
just 55 million acres. Only 2% of all land in the US. Today, that
number is 74 million"

Dukakis was destroyed by that image. At least that was the conclusion
at the time. Reagan "the cowboy" along with HW had won the Cold War
and here is this guy looking like a wimp..  Clinton must have woved

Ammonia cracking looks to be simpler proc than I thought.. 

"Trials have shown that AFC's proprietary fuel cell system can use
'off the shelf' ammonia cracking technology"

[Link](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/211982/afc-energy-tapped-into-growth-of-hydrogen-fuel-use-211982.html)

"The cracking process is thermally efficient and simple"

and

"Ammonia contains 1.7 times as much hydrogen as liquid hydrogen per volume. "

"@DanImmergluck

The newish focus on 'data science' has trivialized the value of deep
knowledge in a topic & true expertise. Now anyone who 'knows data' can
claim equal expertise to folks who have studied a topic for years. And
it‚Äôs a poisonous contributor to this anti-knowledge era"

Blueberry is healthy eh? The study sounds legit.

"For the study, researchers asked a group of overweight and obese
adults between 50 and 75 years old to either¬†consume one cup of
freeze-dried blueberry¬†powder, one placebo that looked like a
blueberry, or a mix that was half freeze-dried blueberry powder and
half placebo once per day for six months, Sharecare.com reports. In
the end, those who ate a full cup of blueberries per day ‚Äúhad less
arterial stiffness, improved vascular function,‚Äù and a higher ‚Äúgood‚Äù
cholesterol level than those who either ate fewer or no blueberries at
all"

"@rodrikdani

A word about manufacturing, prompted by Biden‚Äôs 'buy American'
proposals. It is important to distinguish between production and
employment. 

Manufacturing production exerts outsized influence on a nation‚Äôs
innovative capacity and productivity. It is important to have sensible
industrial policies that promote it. And it‚Äôs possible to reinvigorate
manuf in the sense of preventing a decline in MVA/GDP.

Employment is another matter. Labor content of manufacturing has been
in decline for a very long time (flip side of rising productivity) and
I think it‚Äôs virtually impossible to reverse
employment-deindustrialization. No nation has managed to do it.

The future of jobs is in services: health, education, retail. That‚Äôs
where we need to focus, both to create productive jobs and to ensure
workers are provided with adequate say and job standards. Today‚Äôs
industrial policies have to target services if the objective is good
jobs.

We‚Äôd like to believe that promoting innovation and good jobs are one
and the same, and that a manufacturing oriented policy will kill both
birds with one stone. I‚Äôm afraid that is not the case. Good jobs will
require distinctly different policies that don‚Äôt look like
yesterday‚Äôs.

Having said all of this, on the whole I believe Biden‚Äôs proposals go
in the right direction"

Fighting through alliances; I guess somewhat better than straight up invasion.

"Another example can be found in the Philippines, where special
operations forces have been working steadily with Filipino forces
since 2001, enabling mutually beneficial counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency operations. The resulting partnership between the
United States and the Philippines proved so strong and valuable that
Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte recently reversed his decision to
break from a troop deployment agreement with the United States. The
continuation of this partnership seems even more important for the
United States in light of a recent bipartisan proposal calling for a
'Pacific Deterrence Initiative.'

The initiative seeks to deter China from direct conflict through the
overmatch strategy discussed in the National Security Strategy,
requiring willing partners across Southeast Asia to allow for basing
and logistics hubs for U.S. forces. To even begin preparing for the
large-scale combat operations envisioned by the conventional military,
the United States requires the partnerships enabled by its special
operations forces on a daily basis"

The belligerence of the feckless chinese leadership and their

Factory work doesn't inherently lift people into the middle
class. Those became good jobs because workers imposed their political
