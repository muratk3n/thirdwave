“Fuel cells are the only viable solution for commercial UAV operators
who need significant flight time and we will now work closely with our
partners who are based in the US, Korea and Japan.

A retrospectively fitted 2.4kW mounted onto a DJI M600PRO frame with a
9L 300Bar hydrogen cylinder, could achieve a flight time of over 80
minutes compared to just 20 minutes with its battery power pack.”

Cornell West: "I recall my own experience of protesting in
Charlottesville, Virginia, against hundreds of masked, armed Nazis
with live ammunition in which the police stepped back and remained
still and silent as we were mercilessly attacked. Without the
intervention and protection of antifa, some of us would have
died. Sister Heather Heyer did die. I believe the attack on any
innocent person is wrong, but the focus on the protesters’ assaults on
persons or property takes our attention away from the police killing
of hundreds of black, poor and working-class people"

"@BCAppelbaum

So far as I can tell, our political leaders are divided between those
who say they support the protesters but have no plans to change
anything, and those who aren’t bothering to pretend"
