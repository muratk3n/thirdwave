What a waste

"A natural gas power plant can't always send excess energy into the
grid, frequently leading to waste as the gas is flared or vented
away. However, a plant in Dresden, New York thinks it has a solution:
use that surplus to generate some digital cash"

Here is the idea of interaction for most. Bunch of people standing
around, they come together, and everyone turns to the person to their
right, puts a finger up the ass. Everyone else does the same. Now you
formed a circle, and the circle is __connected__. Then they turn this
circle and start sing Kumbaya... This is the ideal for most people.

Deaths due to war, disease etc are directly proportional to the
density of a population. I wrote about it on 2011,
[here](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2011/11/logistic-equation.html)
and [here](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2011/12/more-on-logistic-equation.html).

Logistic equation, the best predictor of population growth, works well
because it includes a death rate inversely proportional to the density
of a population. Density means more butting heads on resources, more
physical interaction that create conditions ripe for war and
disease.

Decrease interaction. The ideal soc for most is still dumb villagers
in their dumb villages worhipping to bones and stray cats, dogs, with
weirdo rituals. We need to get out, sparsely populate the Earth, even
the areas over and under the sea.

How did inequality change in US over the years? I used "wealth by

from the FED and calculated the Gini coefficient at various times. Code based on [script](https://github.com/ICEACE/MATLAB/blob/master/gini.m).

<img width="340" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESpalJCWsAAfUj8?format=jpg&name=small"/>

Climate skepticism is not a "conservative" position. Being a con has
nothing to do with views on climate. UK cons are pro-climate (we can
thank Thatcher for that). Climate, a secondary issue in terms of
potential agreement, was turned into a primary one to hide the fact
that US became a one-party state. Abortion, guns serve the same
purpose.

UK suffered from one-party-ism too, thanks to "Third Way Blair", but
their cons went berserk in different ways. Anyway, not going into that
anymore, as promised üòâ

"As one panelist, Mahmoud Hanafy, Senior Vice President at Siemens,
put it, ‚ÄúThe Middle East is a blessed region for energy.‚Äù

All seemed to agree, and they weren‚Äôt thinking about oil and gas.

That the energy transition is good news for the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA), that renewables could become a new source of export
income, growing even as income from hydrocarbons declines, was an
important insight that emerged.

Indeed, pilot projects now being launched thousands of miles away in
the Pacific, and planning in Europe, could hold great significance for
MENA. They concern the so-called ‚Äògreen hydrogen‚Äô produced from
renewable energy"

If there are infinitely many stars, why isn't our night sky infinitely
bright? Longer form below:

Webb, *Where is Everybody*: "Suppose the stars are uniformly
distributed throughout space. A star‚Äôs brightness decreases as the
square of its distance from an observer, but the number of stars
increases as the square of the distance from the observer. These two
effects cancel, and each grid shown above contributes the same amount
of brightness. Since there is an infinite number of these grids, the
night sky should be infinitely bright. Even allowing for nearby stars
blocking the light from distant stars, the night sky should be
blindingly bright. Why not?"

Answer: "It turns out that the paradox is explained by one of the most
dramatic discoveries ever made by astronomers: the universe has a
finite age. Since the universe is only about 13.8 billion years old,
the part we can see is finite in size. For the night sky to be as
bright as the surface of the Sun, the observable universe would have
to be almost 1 million times bigger than it is"
