Hey.. if A.C. is on this thing, watch out

"One of the most attractive features of hydrogen technology as an energy carrier is its adaptability and versatility. Furthermore, existing infrastructure can produce, store, and transport energy in multiple ways, and hydrogen can be extracted from renewable and non-renewable resources. Hydrogen can also be converted to methane and electricity to power homes, or transformed into fuel for mobility. Hydrogen is one of the preferred options for storing excess energy produced from renewables‚Äîusing water electrolysis technology, excess renewable electricity is used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, which can then be stored in tanks. Hydrogen gas has the highest energy content of any fuel, as it has the capability to store substantial amounts of energy in a small amount of hydrogen. As a result, the technology is projected to be a low-cost option for energy storage over extended periods of time, making renewables a more attractive energy source for widespread adoption"

"Redox-Flow Cell Stores Renewable Energy as Hydrogen

A redox-flow battery, in essence a reversible fuel cell, is typically
made up of a positive and negative electrolyte stored in two separate
tanks. When the liquids are pumped into the battery cell stack
situated between the tanks, a redox reaction occurs, and generates
electricity at the battery‚Äôs electrodes...

The new redox-flow cell performed well in lab tests, exhibiting a
charge capacity of up to one ampere per square centimeter, a ten-fold
increase over normal flow batteries. It was also able to withstand
‚Äúseveral hundred cycles‚Äù of charging, which has never been
demonstrated before in hydrogen ion flow batteries"

Woa... shortest path problems are indeed solveable as LPs - just
solved one. And LP's internally use continuous methods, as in interior
point styles..barrier, do Newton.. So a discrete prob solvable in
continuous realm. No need for discreteness, loops, stacks and queues
and shit.. Very awesome üññ.

Good [dataset](https://github.com/treselle-systems/customer_churn_analysis)
for churn analysis.

Churn can be seen another case of survival analysis, or time-to-event
statistics... Like a person dying or recovering after treatment,
lightbulb going bust, or crisis happening, etc.

Challenging field bcz some of the data is "right-censored", the
failure event did not take place yet, and it might not take place for
a while.
