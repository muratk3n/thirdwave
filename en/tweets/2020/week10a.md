Given power of corporate stock buybacks in powering the 11-year bull
market, it’s worth considering the risk if corporations decide to
preserve cash and lessen their focus on buybacks"

Because they are scared..? They could be lonely, strangers in a
strange place, what do you do about that? Meet ppl who are like you,
or you make people like you (children). It wont work
necessarily.. Kids can feel that and want to help their folks, act a
certain way but they will always be different, local. If that sits
badly parents shouldn't have left their shithole country.

"Why would immigrant parents expect[ their kids act like them even tho
the kids are now local to their country?"

Elections are about candidates. Get elected somehow, and enact
policies (which people don't know shit about) and get judged by a
rough, overall success of them.

(Surely u want to get elected while u promise the said policies so u
can declare u have a 'mandate' if elected, but that's the secondary
game. The primary game is getting your ass into that frickin post).

The current "system" is nowhere near at its optimal given its
technological base. 3W progress is patchy. For large-scale systems you
design for connectivity loss, problems, shutdowns from ground-up. We
need to be ready for intermittency, not constant connectiviy.

"Constant connectivity defines 21st-century life, and the
infrastructure undergirding it all is both digital (the internet and
our social media platforms) and physical (the gig economy, e-commerce,
global workplaces). Despite a tumultuous first two decades of the
century, much of our connected way of life has evaded the stress of a
singular global event. The possibility of a global pandemic currently
posed by the new coronavirus threatens to change that altogether"

Like I said death rate is closer to 10% than 1%. The way to calculate it is
death / death + recovered. From the latest China numbers,

```
Confirmed  Deaths	Recoveries
79,251	   2,835	39,246
```

```python
2835 / (39246.0+2835) * 100.0
```

```text
Out[1]: 6.73700720039923

Death rate is nearly 7%. This is huge. It can kill half a billion people!

ROIC = Return on Invested Capital. Seems like a good metric to judge
company by. From [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-metrics-return-equity-return-220854430.html),

"ROIC measures the return that an investment generates for those who
have provided capital and how well a company generates cash flow
relative to the capital it has invested in its business."

Formula

NOPAT / Average Invested Capital

NOPAT = Operating Income * (1 - Tax Rate))

Average Invested Capital = (Total Shareholder's Equity + Debt - Cash)

Tax Rate = 25.75%

They do the AIC as average btw to quarters. I just took Q4. Operating
income is a sum of last 4 quarters, the rest again Q4.

I once read somewhere he called himself "Middle Eastern" (bcz he was a
Jew?) 🙄🙄🙄 C'mon guy. This is getting ridiculous.

"In a humorous aside Einstein once remarked that 'if relativity is
proved right the Germans will call me a German, the Swiss call me a
Swiss citizen, and the French will call me a great scientist. If
relativity is proved wrong the French will call me a Swiss, the Swiss
will call me a German, and the Germans will call me a Jew.'"

From the point of view of other animal species humans are the worst

So, we need to prepare for the worst, a pandemic, by not irrationally
