"[W]hat isn't discussed is how Mr. 'Content Is King' got his 'content'
...  [Redstone] bested business rivals throughout his long career as
he engineered deals for Viacom, Paramount and CBS and displayed an
unwavering passion to win. ... Viacom Networks (MTV, BET, Comedy
Central, CMT), the engine that drove Redstone's media empire was
almost entirely built on 'reality', 'live' and 'free' content. Which
is to say, Redstone's genius was finding a way to pipe content made
and paid for by other people (music labels, comedy clubs) on to
cable. And to fill the gap with non-union, unprotected 'perma-lance'
innovation in-house. Reality and music television was just
union-busting. Plain and simple. ... Reality television can seem
exciting and glamorous. Working on reality television, much less
so. As the following stories from "professionally abused" insiders
show, reality TV workers will continue... 'My Super Sweet 16'? A PA
came up with that. 'Jersey Shore'? Just a rip-off of a True Life
pitched by an AP. There was no IP ownership. No health-care. And
Redstone's bet was freelance 20 year olds wouldn't have the stones to
organize or sue"

"Brian Lee Hitchens, a Florida taxi driver ... who prayed in the
morning before going shopping or carrying passengers without a mask,
was sure that nothing would happen to him and his asthma-sick
wife. God would take care of him. And possibly the entire corona hype
is mere hysteria anyway, as could be read on the Internet, and the
virus is no more dangerous than ordinary flu. Then he fell ill
himself, then his wife, who struggled for weeks to survive. While
still in the hospital, Brian Lee Hitchens wrote on Facebook about his
change of heart 'The virus is not a fake, the pandemic is real. It is
important to heed the advice of experts' [he wrote]"

From the ACC novel abt a Titan colony, 23rd century.. The comm issue
would be real. No Zoom calls with Saturn 

A. C. Clarke: "It might have been different if the velocity of light
were infinite; but it was a mere billion kilometers an hour—and
therefore, real-time conversation would be forever impossible between
Earth and anyone beyond the orbit of the Moon. The global electronic
village which had existed for centuries on the mother world could
never be extended into space; the political and psychological effects
of this were enormous, and still not fully understood"

This rule is ironclad. Other rules in scifi can be bent or broken, not
this one.

Another one; If there is an evil twin in the other universe, he must
have the goatee. We know that. [Here](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h4xCSLl0L_M/Tuoepd3YEZI/AAAAAAAAMRY/oFwqSTR_XSw/s1600/spock.jpg)

But the real rule is "reverse-facial-hair" rule. So if you have goatee
in this universe, then your evil twin must have no goatee in the other
universe. Example below, Trek DS9.
