C++ truly is fast as shit. It's just f-ing raw speed. Close to the metal.

A million particles in a simulation. An early code had >4000 but with
an inefficient O(N^2) which tells me in O(n) setting, that frees up
proc, ~1 Million cld be fine.

---

Biden was a good candidate. The incumbent was deeply unpopular, and
the election rested mostly on his delivery, but the Biden campaign
provided the ultimate opposite, neutralized the other side's strengths
well.

"A slew of moderate lawmakers, whose wins in the 2018 midterms handed
the gavel again to Pelosi, have lost or are on track to lose their
seats. Meanwhile, several establishment Democrats are set to be
replaced by staunch progressives, shifting Democrats’ political center
of gravity further left in the lower chamber of Congress"

Can we tie (representative) democracy status (a score between 0-10) to
trade barriers -- more democracy gets more trade.

---

Haha DETO instead of NATO? Democratic Earth Treaty Organization. Only
democracies are allowed, members face dismissal if they backtrack on
democracy. Unified defense, increased trade, etc.

They use hair to clean oil spills. 

"There's a good reason hair gets oily. It's because your hair follicles
have little fat glands that ooze oil onto your hair... Well, now
scientists in Australia have taken a cue from nature to see how well
hair and fur can absorb a different kind of oil - crude oil"

On the face of it, looks fine.. More friends for Israel is a good
thing (I do want them to exist, also plz try to kill less
Palestenians). But if ripping up an existing peace deal caused the
hostility in the first place, then is lining up bunch of allies behind
Israel an unnecessary fix?

Wld US also strategically prefer an ME Cold War? Or have everyone be
in a concillatory / neutral state to both itself, Israel and
eachother?

We cant just do the "out-of-the-ordinary" for the eff of it, or for
tactics. There needs to be some strategic sense to it all.

"But isn't an outsider like Trump a good thing bcz he did the untried,
Israel is now being recognized by many new Arab states"

---

Third Wave tech is overwhelming Second Wave institutions. IMO to
provide some sort of sanity before the ultimate shift, we need to cut
off the extra noise, otherwise the central institutions will be
bombarded. The noise will do no good anyway -- e.g. Newt sitting in
front of a chatroom w trolls bombarding the singular Speaker.

---

We should remove even the smallest direct-dem practices, along with
referandums, making the whole process to go through
representatives. Remember the California recall election circus?

---

Dont put voters on the spot for issues. Get elected somehow, enact
policy, be reelected on their success.

---

Progs probably did not like that outcome. Be comforted with the fact
that voters dont know much

"Californians overwhelmingly voted in favour of Prop 22, exempting
app-based ride-hailing and delivery services from classifying drivers
as employees eligible for benefits and job protections"

"@gabrielazanfir

For us [at EFF], Prop 24 [allows consumers to prevent businesses from
sharing personal information, etc] is rather a mixed bag of partial
steps backwards and forwards"

"@ryanobles

Because it took longer than normal to count the votes, there is the
impression that the results were close. As @zbyronwolf points out-
@JoeBiden’s victory was much more decisive than you think"

CNBC: "An $11 trillion global hydrogen energy boom is coming. Here’s
what could trigger it... Storing fuel in salt caverns isn’t new, but
hydrogen’s growing role in decarbonization has revitalized interest in
the concept.

The Advanced Clean Energy Storage project in Utah aims to build the
world’s largest storage facility for 1,000 megawatts of clean power,
partly by putting hydrogen into underground salt caverns. The concept
is quickly gaining momentum in Europe.

Some 130 miles south of Salt Lake City, engineers are working on what
will become a giant cavity in the ground. It’s a geological formation
known as a salt dome, a column of salt surrounded by sedimentary
layers, and when it’s filled with hydrogen, it could become one of the
largest renewable energy reservoirs in the world"

Simulation can be a whole new type of business domain. Any
manufacturing company, before manufacturing anything, can ask these
guys to run simulations on the parts they will produce before they
produce them in bulk.

---

There is always action in US on pretty much everything, being at the
center of research, but the Kraut, and the French, and the Aussies
always seem to have a foot in the door, in those same fields. Brits
too of course.

---

Swell.

These guys are good..

From dive solutions GmbH, Berlin.

"We then attempted to replicate these observations with a quick SPH
simulation. The flow field in the simulations and the experiment are
in satisfying agreement. The matching flow patterns indicate that the
fluid dynamics at the higher speeds are reproduced with certainty as
well"

They can increase renewable use through solar, they certainly have a
lot of direct sunshine.

Min says solar generation is done for 6 hours, 1/4th of a day -same
guesstimate I'd used earlier-. For renewable storage; [GenCell](2019/07/gencell.md)
is local right?

"@mnd1103

@JRubinBlogger with all due respect, this is a terrible piece. Ky
Democrats have run 6 moderate candidates in a row against McConnell,
each less inspiring than the previous & losing every time. @Booker4KY
is inspiring & genuine. Unless @AmyMcGrathKY can become both, it’s a
loss.

Shell gets it.

Fossil energy companies can win in a renewable fuel economy (there
wont be a 'battery economy' as the amount of lithium reserves are
limited). But many companies have the know-how to transport, process
chemical fuels, they only have to adapt to a somewhat different type
of fuel. A win-win for all.

Guess what, Japan is [ready](https://youtu.be/5ejL65tKsGM?t=107) for that shit. 

"Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, last month shipped the
world's first shipment of "blue" ammonia – produced using hydrogen
derived from fossil fuels and capturing the carbon emissions – to
Japan, to be used in zero-carbon power generation"
