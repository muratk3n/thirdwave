"Veterinary scientist hailed for Faroe Islands’ lack of Covid-19
deaths ...The success of the Faroese approach is said by local
politicians to be largely a result of the foresight of the veterinary
scientist Debes Christiansen ...

His laboratory, which was primarily geared to test salmon for viral
infection, was adapted and he purchased the extra ingredients required
to test humans ...

Christiansen told the Guardian that the switch to human testing had
not involved “too much hocus pocus” and that his veterinarian
laboratory had been able to source materials required for the tests
from a wider range of suppliers than hospitals ...

Tracking and tracing has been a very important part. It has been
possible to trace all the people who have been tested positive and who
they have been with. And they have been put in quarantine for two
weeks'"

"@nfergus

Questions for Xi Jinping ....  After it became clear that there was a
full-blown epidemic spreading from Wuhan to the rest of Hubei
province, why did you cut off travel from Hubei to the rest of China —
on Jan. 23 — but not from Hubei to the rest of the world?"

"Raworth’s 2017 bestselling book, *Doughnut Economics* .. has graced
the bedside table of people ranging from the former Brexit secretary
David Davis to the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who described it
as a “breakthrough alternative to growth economics”.

The inner ring of her donut sets out the minimum we need to lead a
good life, derived from the UN’s sustainable development goals and
agreed by world leaders of every political stripe. It ranges from food
and clean water to a certain level of housing, sanitation, energy,
education, healthcare, gender equality, income and political
voice. Anyone not attaining such minimum standards is living in the
doughnut’s hole.

The outer ring of the doughnut, where the sprinkles go, represents the
ecological ceiling drawn up by earth-system scientists. It highlights
the boundaries across which human kind should not go to avoid damaging
the climate, soils, oceans, the ozone layer, freshwater and abundant
biodiversity.

Between the two rings is the good stuff: the dough, where everyone’s
needs and that of the planet are being met"

Direct cash payments would work - and that's the problem, it would
work too well. Dems cannot help Reps in an election season.

Politics is deadly, as deadly as war, if not more.

"The fact that Pelosi had the chance to lead this charge a week ago
and demurred, insisting on means testing as a condition, is blinkered
and insane, on both the politics and the policy merits. The downside
of means testing is that the "testing" part takes time and
bureaucracy"
