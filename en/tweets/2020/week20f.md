"@ggreenwald

One of the many problems with the US media is that as jobs disappear,
young journalists are increasingly deterred from questioning or
challenging prevailing media narratives because it can be
career-destroying. The overwhelming incentive is to affirm media
pieties or stay quiet"

"The world already safeguards 15% of its land and 7% of the ocean. But,
for the sake of our health and prosperity, we must do more. Indeed,
there is increasing agreement among countries that we need to return
half the planet to nature and use the other half responsibly, and that
we should start by protecting at least 30% of it by 2030"

Our relationship with nature is broken, says @Enric_Sala of
@NG_PristineSeas. And that has brought us into closer and more
frequent contact with viruses that can spread from animals to people"

At some point thereâ€™s gonna be 295 million Americans without health
insurance, and Democrats and their shills in DC will be saying
Medicare for All is too idealistic, letâ€™s write a $50 trillion check
to the CEOs of UnitedHealth and Aetna to pay them to deal with the
issue"

A-A! Let's not get mad. I know [Italian karate](https://youtu.be/n-ENUWAxzc0). I am warning you.

Oh yeah? You Italian?

Do you like gabagol?

No? What kind of Italian are you, if you don't like gabagol? You must
be confused.

Someone circulated the "R was now above 1 in DE" news few weeks ago. I
checked for that week, untrue.

Yes, but your tone is in arrears, jerkoff. This talk needs to come
from a place of caution, not "they said don't dance, but I want to
dance!" ala Kevin Bacon in *Footlose*.

"But many others say, we need to return to normal, reopen"

For the past days I have seen a lot of stories saying Covid cases have
dramatically increased in Germany after easing lockdown
restrictions. I don't know where that myth comes from. Look at the
data. Nothing like that has happened (yet)"
