Hey if u missed the boat on the next consumer OS dominance, you can
always sue to get your cut.

"Every time you buy an Android smartphone or tablet, Microsoft is
likely receiving 5 to 15 dollars. They likely make at least $2 billion
per year from Android. This financial agreement is all about patent
royalties. Microsoft claims to hold software patents that Android
infringes on, and they threaten lawsuits against Android device
manufacturers until they settle"

"University College London (UCL) has recorded the world‚Äôs fastest data
transmission speed, reaching 178 terabits a second -or 178,000,000
megabits a second- by using a bandwidth of 16.8 THz.

At double the capacity of any system currently deployed in the world,
the speed was close to the theoretical limit of data transmission set
out by American mathematician Claude Shannon in 1949.

The record was achieved by a research team led by Dr Lidia Galdino
(pictured), lecturer at UCL and Royal Academy of Engineering research
fellow, in collaboration with Xtera and KDDI Research.

Not only did they achieve the speeds ‚Äì outperforming the previous
record set by researchers in Japan by one fifth ‚Äì the team also found
such speeds could be deployed on already existing infrastructure.

In 'real terms', 178 terabits a second is so fast it would be possible
to download the entire Netflix library in less than a second.  ..

The record was achieved by transmitting data through a much wider
range of colours of light, or wavelengths, than is typically used in
optical fibre"

In 1968 Carl Sagan was denied tenure at his university. Let that sink
in, CS, one of the best explainers of science, a visible scientific
personality, was denied tenure. They were correct in doing so, "being
an explainer" doesn't mean a research is being furthered in any
front. TAlking to bunch of uninformed people, "popularizing" is not
research. It could be inspiring people, but that's about it. You can't
do science by publicity.

McCain and Romney were both close to libertards, but their elec loss
doesnt mean the mov is discredited. 2008 crisis wouldnt happen in a

---

Distinct right needs to exist just like distinct left. Going lukewarm
on each issue (centrism) doesn't work. Mixing distinct issues from
each side doesn't work (fascism). Clear-cut ideology needs to be in
different parties. We need tards in GOP being against excessive
regulation, pro-market, etc.. and a left party being opposite of that.

---

I bash libertards sometimes but they should be in charge of the
Republican Party. And moving towards distinct ideologies was taking
place actually, The Tea Party movement was all about this, no? But GOP
got sidetracked from that somehow (bcz of fear? but then ended with
something far worse, in their eyes).

Scientists then were essentially looking at a 2D projection of a 3D
system, which they did not know but had to reason about
mathematically. They had to be a mathematical detective. *This* is
science. None of that process is thought, or even hinted at, at
schools, even to kids who can grasp it. What we teach today is
cargo-cult science, even if the material is the outcome of real
science.

---

Teaching science wout teaching how scientist came up with that
science, makes zero sense. Now we know about planets, orbits, our
sun-centric system, we see pictures like the one below all over the
place, in many books thanks to the scientist that led to them.

<img width="340" src="https://ak.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/1006650247/thumb/1.jpg"/>

But that's not what they themselves saw in the sky. When they looked,
for example at Mars, over many days, this is what they saw,

This is 2D. Bunch of dots on a (sky) screen. How do you get to the
first picture from the second? How did Copernicus do it? This was the
biggest detective story of the ancient times. Skipping that train of
thought is a disservice too all students.
