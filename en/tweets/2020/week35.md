# Week 35

People wld still suffer, bcz of the shortcomings of the market, sure,
e.g. they'd have to organize a GoFundMe for a dentist appointment, but
then the cure would be clearer; the opposition party.

---

McCain and Romney were both close to libertards, but their elec loss
doesnt mean the mov is discredited. 2008 crisis wouldnt happen in a
truly market econ, libertards hate them. Fenni Mae and Freddie Mac are
*centrist* institutions. Part gov, part market, little in, little out,
doing massive securitization with gov guarantee.. how is this not a
f-ing abomination, hallmark of centrism?

---

Distinct right needs to exist just like distinct left. Going lukewarm
on each issue (centrism) doesn't work. Mixing distinct issues from
each side doesn't work (fascism). Clear-cut ideology needs to be in
different parties. We need tards in GOP being against excessive
regulation, pro-market, etc.. and a left party being opposite of that.

---

I bash libertards sometimes but they should be in charge of the
Republican Party. And moving towards distinct ideologies was taking
place actually, The Tea Party movement was all about this, no? But GOP
got sidetracked from that somehow (bcz of fear? but then ended with
something far worse, in their eyes).

He tried to do this *before* the pandemic BTW

Reining in drug prices? What are you -- a leftist?

There is a maaaarket, supply, and demaaaand.

I guess he didn't care.

Scientists then were essentially looking at a 2D projection of a 3D
system, which they did not know but had to reason about
mathematically. They had to be a mathematical detective. *This* is
science. None of that process is thought, or even hinted at, at
schools, even to kids who can grasp it. What we teach today is
cargo-cult science, even if the material is the outcome of real
science.

---

Teaching science wout teaching how scientist came up with that
science, makes zero sense. Now we know about planets, orbits, our
sun-centric system, we see pictures like the one below all over the
place, in many books thanks to the scientist that led to them.

But that's not what they themselves saw in the sky. When they looked,
for example at Mars, over many days, this is what they saw,

This is 2D. Bunch of dots on a (sky) screen. How do you get to the
first picture from the second? How did Copernicus do it? This was the
biggest detective story of the ancient times. Skipping that train of
thought is a disservice too all students.

"A new type of plastic that can be easily broken down into its chemical
building blocks and reassembled into high-quality products
could reduce the amount of plastic waste ending up in landfill"

Not bad. 

"Isaac Newton estimated, without access to reliable measurement, that
the density of Earth would be five or six times as great as the
density of water, which is surprisingly accurate (the modern value is
5.515). Newton under-estimated the Earth's volume by about 30%, so
that his estimate would be roughly equivalent to 4.2±0.5 × 10^24 kg"
