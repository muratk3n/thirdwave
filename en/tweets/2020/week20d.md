Saw on Fox News, fem anchor says "they say dont touch your face", and
she goes ahead touches her face -- SUCH CUTE defiance. ARE YOU A CHILD???

Dana Perino is it?? And I thought she was one of the smart ones.

This is what codes do to people. You start acting stupid. Get off code.

That is f--ing crazy

"@Rainmaker1973

The story of Joan Murray, who survived a 4,500 meter fall when her
main parachute failed while skydiving. She landed in a fire ant mound
where numerous venomous stings caused an adrenaline rush to keep her
heart beating long enough for doctors to assist"

Goldcucks think with their precious gold, there is no centralized
printing. Wrong. The reason gold came into being as money was
precisely because it could be printed!  By the king! Gold became what
it is because it could be dug (printed) only someone with lots of
resources who could employ people at mines, to unearth this rare
looking metal that was hard to fake that made it a perfect currency --
for a while.

There is always printing. With no printing, there is deflation. Now
that we figured out printing other currencies and back it with
governments and/or trust networks, gold and similar items today become
side-shows, commodities but can never form the basis of a currency,
let alone a world currency.

I maintain that any digital currency continually needs to expand its
monetary base, ideally print the money into everyone's account, weekly
or monthly, as a form of digital basic income. It will generate little
inflation, reduce the incentive to store / stash etc. and devalue curr
shifting some wealth from rich to poor. The excess doesn't even need
to be inflationary, new, inventive ways of lending can be formed, the
excess can flow to businesses as credit, creates growth, more goods
chasing more money = little inflation.
