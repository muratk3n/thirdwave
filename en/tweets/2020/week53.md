Here's a simple way that can happen..  Let's say u dont want to wait
for 1, 2, or 8 hrs to charge. Then u say "we'll just have a swap
mechanism, u give your empty one, get a charged one". Right there, you
just doubled the amount of lithium needed bcz on top of the lithium
needed for cars, now u need just as much lithium for bats that are
waiting, offline to be picked up in case of a swap.

"But doubling the usage of lithium for transport does not seem likely,
we can make do with what we have"

One of those canisters could be charged in 10 minutes BTW. Most
e-bikes on the market I see require hours of recharging with meager
range.

Lavo Bike?

Lavo BBQ?

Energy reqs of some household items

* Single burner electric stove: 1500 Watts
* TV: 80-400 Watts
* Fridge: 100-250 watts

Lavo storage unit has;

* 40 kWh capacity
* Output Voltage Range: 45 â€“ 53 V DC
* 30 yrs lifespan (10 times more than the equivalent battery tech)
* Main element used hydrogen hydride is non-toxic, fully recyclable

Great H2 storage company [LAVO](https://lavo.com.au) whose tech turns
renewable fuel into a long-term storage mechanism.

[FRED graph](2019/05/stats.md#t3mff), 3-month treasury and FEDFUNDS
differential.

When the difference is out of whack, it can be a signal things are
about to go kaboom.

Since IR is a short term rate, it would be logical to assume the
instrument that is effected by IR the most can be a predictor of
it. This is the 3-month treasury bill, something the market constantly
votes on with their money. The paper below suggests 3-month treasury
price has some predictive value. 

"This paper shows that the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and
the federal funds rate has significant predictive power for the future
change in the federal funds rate during the volatile nonborrowed
reserves operating regime, but it has less and no predictive power
during the borrowed reserves regime and the federal funds targeting
regime, respectively. These findings suggest that Treasury bill rates
forecast future federal funds rates most accurately when the Federal
Reserve follows a well-defined rule that does not smooth the impact of
shocks on the federal funds rate"

But guess what, BJ agreed to it.

>NI will stay in the EU single market for goods and will continue to
>enforce EU customs rules at its ports. This will .. create a new 'sea
>border' with the rest of the UK

FREEEEDOM!

"[N]o UK prime minster could ever agree to it," Theresa May had said
[about an earlier text the commission have published] "which would, if
implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the
constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and reg
border down the Irish Sea".

*Supernatural* ended.. After 15 years! Great show... I bet it was
 inspired by *Constantine* when it first started.

Fast, fast... Lots o' particles simulated through the GPU..
