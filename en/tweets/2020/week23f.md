"Japan, Germany and France will this fiscal year begin jointly
developing a reusable rocket that can return to Earth after launch.

Reusable rockets are expected to reduce the cost of missions and
provide a welcome boost to the space industry. The project also aims
to utilize a Japan-Europe framework to reduce the gap between the
United States, which is ahead in the practical application of such
technology"

We tried the body cameras. We tried the implicit bias training. We
tried hiring different officers. We tried police yoga. These things do
not stop the killing because they do not change the balance of power"

In 2014, some Democratic lawmakers pushed legislation to block the

they control the House, Dems have the power to insert that prohibition

Yeah. Someone up the chain dropped the ball so we still study all of

@kevinbaker

I don't think you can count on mayors and city councils to do the
right thing, so the trick is going to be making them more afraid of
protests than they are of cops and cop unions. There's evidence that
this is already starting to happen in some cities.

So true... Same goes for internal problems 

Friedman: "In geopolitics there is a key measure known as the 'margin
of error.'  It predicts how much room a country has for making
mistakes.  The margin of error consists of two parts: the types of
danger faced by a nation and the amount of power it possesses. Some
countries have very small margins of error. They tend to obsess over
the smallest detail of foreign policy, aware that the slightest
misstep can be catastrophic.  Israel and Palestine do not have massive
margins of error, because of their small size and their
location. Iceland, on the other hand, has a lot of room for
mistakes. It is small but lives in a roomy neighborhood.  The United
States has a huge margin of error.  It is safe in North America and
has tremendous power. The United States therefore tends to be careless
in how it exercises its power globally.  It's not stupid.  It simply
doesn't need to be more carefulâ€”in fact, being more careful could
often reduce its efficiency.  Like a banker prepared to make bad loans
in the expectation that he will do well in the long run, the United
States has a policy of making moves that other countries see as
reckless.  The results would be painful or even devastating for other
countries.  The United States moves on and flourishes"

Mountains are natural borders. Why do Indians and the Chinese look so
differently even tho they are neighbors? I believe these peoples were
isolated from one another for a long time. It's tough to have an
interactions, or war over those mountains. CH seems to be trying very
hard at that Pangong lake in Ladakh tho.

"The Himalaya mountain range separates China from India. This range
spans 1,500 miles throughout five countries"
