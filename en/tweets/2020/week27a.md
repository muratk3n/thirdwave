What if I told you the core function of selective private colleges is
to reinforce class hierarchies and there is no renaming or diversity
initiative that can possibly recast the project as compatible with
egalitarian values?"

No. I am for expertise. Go to Wash, get better at what you
do. Journalists, keep pols in check. That term limit concept, along
with a lot of "populist", "people governance" biz is now coming to an
end, it seems. See Jesse Ventura (for term limits, ousider etc).. Good
guy but nothing going on there.. tone is like Trump's (who actually
along with McCain copied his style), and DJT himself might check out
soon?

"Are you for term limits?"

No. This is the scale you want gov to be involved, and this is the
right discussion to have.. Higgs Boson was confirmed in 2012, 8 years
ago.. LHC did some good. WWW came out of CERN. But it is becoming
clear String Theory will not get confirmation from LHC. Continue discussion.

It's probably [cultural](../../2020/07/robot-frankenstein.md). Fine 4

My dad is in jail on a conspiracy charge. Which means people said he had drugs on him but they never found drugs on him. You can kill somebody and still get out of jail before my dad. They gave him 2 life sentences. A couple years ago they made this law illegal..let my dad go!

"@Jkylebass

Now that the predatory 'no-bid' OBOR contract with the Chinese has
been declared illegal by Kenyan courts, other African nations being
preyed upon and bribed by the CCP should default in a chain-reaction.

OBOR is the chinese Communist‚Äôs method of bribing local officials to
take on crippling debt for overpriced projects that are then built by
chinese slave labor. The chinese workers are brought into 'work camps'
and fed by the CCP. There is next to zero local positive GDP impact

And the CCP expects payments on the projects to be made in USD. It‚Äôs
time for an African Jubilee on illegal chinese loans.
