Taibbi: "Why Did Democrats Nominate Donna Shalala to the Bailout Oversight
Panel?

With the Congressional Oversight Committee, Democrats had a rare
opportunity to reverse public perception about the party’s closeness
to Wall Street. Instead, they punted again"

"@anunezjimenez

In my lifetime, I have seen things one would not believe:

- negative interest rates

- negative electricity prices

- negative crude oil futures

I am not yet 30 years old"

I wouldn't brush this event off as a "financial pecularity". Futures
are the most down-to-earth financial construct there is - you get
delivery of a certain commodity, on a pre-specified date, for a
pre-specified amount. Due to storage costs the price went negative but
that highlights something, there is no storage left for oil, demand died.

"@p_hbar_k

This contract expires tomorrow. Whoever holds the contract has to take
custody of physical oil and there is no place to put it. Hence, they
are willing to pay to take that burden off of them. June contract is
trading above $20 (so far) though"

Nikola vs Tesla. Nice match up. I hope US takes the side of the

"Eeww but what of RBG?" What of RBG? U look at all the Clint, Bam
appointments, were they for the working man, small biz, or
pro-corporate?

"But RBG is pro-abortion". That highlights the faux division that is
required the keep the kabuki theater going, while corporations buy out
America and the rest of the world.
