@zackkanter

Facebook & TikTok privacy issues are easy for NYT reporters to mix up. One way to keep them straight is to apply 'the Uyghur test' - if you're a Uyghur using the app in its country of origin, are you in danger of: 1) being targeted w/a desk ad, or 2) having your organs harvested?

Little scraping.. got 10 random numbers btw 1 and 10.

Seems to work.

Good shit.

```python
import urllib.request as req, re

URL = "https://www.random.org/integers/?num=10&min=1&max=10" + \
      "&col=1&base=10&format=html&rnd=newb" 
r = req.urlopen(URL).read().decode('utf-8')
dd = re.findall(r'<pre class=\"data\">(.*?)</pre>', r, re.DOTALL)[0]
[int(x) for x in dd.split("\n") if len(x) > 0]
```

```text
Out[1]: [3, 1, 5, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 9]

There it is

"RANDOM.ORG offers true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The
randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is
better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in
computer programs"

Need some true number generation..

Reuters: "The president‚Äôs demand for schools to fully reopen this fall

"Local news is extremely easy to take for granted. It is, by
definition, narrow in its interests. But even beyond serving as the
core of America‚Äôs news ecosystem, local news can be the glue that
connects people in a given community. 'It‚Äôs the way a local columnist
can express a community‚Äôs frustration or triumph .. the way the local
music critic can review a concert, the deeply reported feature
stories, the assessment of a new restaurant, the obituaries, the
letters to the editor. The newspaper ties a region together, helps it
make sense of itself.‚Äù

They had con radio.. this is a good point, such radio is mostly
centralized, "federal" in nature, they talk abt con issues but in
overarching, generalized tones, pushing broad buttons.. So they don't
really give a shit about your local problems, and in many ways, are
toxic for politics, especially the local kind.

*The Atlantic*: "McMurray‚Äôs opponent, the incumbent [congressman]
Chris Collins, had recently been indicted on charges of insider
trading. The Buffalo News ... broke the story of the indictment, and
some TV stations picked up the News‚Äôs reporting. Readers and viewers
in areas that had strong local news presences .. learned of the
indictment and, armed with that information, voted accordingly. But
many in the sprawling district were not so equipped. 'I‚Äôd be going
door to door,' McMurray [says] 'or meeting with people at a diner or a
fair, for example, and in the most isolated areas, a lot of people had
no idea that their own congressman had been indicted.' He notes that
Orleans County, a rural area of the district classified as a news
desert, was ‚Äúone of the toughest places.' People there, according to
McMurray, had ‚Äúgossip, conservative radio, or social media.' They had
echo chambers. They did not, however, have news. And so, by a
razor-thin margin, Chris Collins ‚Äî who would go on to plead guilty to
two felonies, be sentenced to prison, and resign from Congress ‚Äî won
the election"
