"@justinamash

Violence will not bring justice, and silence will not bring
peace. Speak out. Take action. The callous murder of George Floyd
symbolizes the cold indifference of too many legislators, police and
prosecutors, judges and juries. We have denied justice. We have
prevented peace"

@gravity_levity

I think I was well past a PhD in physics before I realized that a rocket never actually has to achieve "escape velocity" in order to escape earth's orbit. It can be lifted arbitrarily slowly, so long as the thrust always exceeds the local gravitational force.

@drewmckevitt

There's actually a great deal of evidence that police violence is so much more pervasive and deadly in the United States precisely because there are so many guns here. Police tactics have evolved to assume everyone is potentially an armed enemy prepared to kill them

Of course he did. There was the right focus on science, all the
reforms that were talked about in the past 100+ yrs were
enacted. Changing the alphabet, women's rights, etc. The problem is
with the national narrative, which bordered on the fantastical. But
what makes it worse is how Kemal enmeshed his persona in those fairy
tales so now seperating the two is impossible. But it needs to be
done. A new Republic possibly. The French do that, no? They number
them too, like 1st, 2nd..?

"But didn't Kemal of TR do some good stuff?"
