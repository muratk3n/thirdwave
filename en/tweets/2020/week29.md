Very important, that "win". Signified a beginning of an era. 

The Atlantic: "Nevertheless, [Ingraham] still occasionally reconfirms,
on her television programs or in public speeches, the main thing I
associated her with in the 1990s: a devotion to Ronald Reagan and
Reaganism, the same devotion that would have been shared, back then,
by all of those people at Brock‚Äôs cocktail party [with other neo
muckers]. Or perhaps devotion to Reagan is a bit too specific. What
really held that group together‚Äîand what drew me to it as well‚Äîwas a
kind of post‚ÄìCold War optimism, a belief that 'we had won,'"

They had con radio.. this is a good point, such radio is mostly
centralized, "federal" in nature, they talk abt con issues but in
overarching, generalized tones, pushing broad buttons.. So they don't
really give a shit about your local problems, and in many ways, are
toxic for politics, especially the local kind.

*The Atlantic*: "McMurray‚Äôs opponent, the incumbent [congressman]
Chris Collins, had recently been indicted on charges of insider
trading. The Buffalo News ... broke the story of the indictment, and
some TV stations picked up the News‚Äôs reporting. Readers and viewers
in areas that had strong local news presences .. learned of the
indictment and, armed with that information, voted accordingly. But
many in the sprawling district were not so equipped. 'I‚Äôd be going
door to door,' McMurray [says] 'or meeting with people at a diner or a
fair, for example, and in the most isolated areas, a lot of people had
no idea that their own congressman had been indicted.' He notes that
Orleans County, a rural area of the district classified as a news
desert, was ‚Äúone of the toughest places.' People there, according to
McMurray, had ‚Äúgossip, conservative radio, or social media.' They had
echo chambers. They did not, however, have news. And so, by a
razor-thin margin, Chris Collins ‚Äî who would go on to plead guilty to
two felonies, be sentenced to prison, and resign from Congress ‚Äî won
the election"

innovative capacity and productivity. It is important to have sensible
industrial policies that promote it. And it‚Äôs possible to reinvigorate
manuf in the sense of preventing a decline in MVA/GDP.

Employment is another matter. Labor content of manufacturing has been
in decline for a very long time (flip side of rising productivity) and
I think it‚Äôs virtually impossible to reverse
employment-deindustrialization. No nation has managed to do it.

The future of jobs is in services: health, education, retail. That‚Äôs
where we need to focus, both to create productive jobs and to ensure
workers are provided with adequate say and job standards. Today‚Äôs
industrial policies have to target services if the objective is good
jobs.

We‚Äôd like to believe that promoting innovation and good jobs are one
and the same, and that a manufacturing oriented policy will kill both
birds with one stone. I‚Äôm afraid that is not the case. Good jobs will
require distinctly different policies that don‚Äôt look like
yesterday‚Äôs.

Having said all of this, on the whole I believe Biden‚Äôs proposals go
in the right direction"

Fighting through alliances; I guess somewhat better than straight up invasion.

"Another example can be found in the Philippines, where special
operations forces have been working steadily with Filipino forces
since 2001, enabling mutually beneficial counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency operations. The resulting partnership between the
United States and the Philippines proved so strong and valuable that
Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte recently reversed his decision to
break from a troop deployment agreement with the United States. The
continuation of this partnership seems even more important for the
United States in light of a recent bipartisan proposal calling for a
'Pacific Deterrence Initiative.'

The initiative seeks to deter China from direct conflict through the
overmatch strategy discussed in the National Security Strategy,
requiring willing partners across Southeast Asia to allow for basing
and logistics hubs for U.S. forces. To even begin preparing for the
large-scale combat operations envisioned by the conventional military,
the United States requires the partnerships enabled by its special
operations forces on a daily basis"

The belligerence of the feckless chinese leadership and their
authorized propaganda outlets continues to amaze me. Their global
economic and military aggression is rooted in the Potemkin village of
a closed capital account and coercion of USD into china. It‚Äôs their
Achilles heel"

Factory work doesn't inherently lift people into the middle
class. Those became good jobs because workers imposed their political
will. Service-sector jobs could be good jobs, too"
