Haha. Found a doc "Development of Virtual Blade Model for Modelling

"Gen 3 [ammonia generation] technology is based on the electroreduction
of N2 to ammonia by direct or mediated means. The H-B process is no
longer required; instead, the reaction is driven by electrochemical
reduction and the H source is water.

There are several modes of this process being actively researched:

eNRR in which an electrocatalyst enables direct electron and proton
addition to the N2 molecule; and indirect or mediated mechanisms in
which a redox mediator such as Li+ is first reduced and then, via a
series of reactions, ammonia is produced and the mediator is
regenerated"

The equiv hardware with bitch batteries weigh at least 3 times as
much, and I see warnings like "can only be charged 3000 times"
etc. This tech is obscenely inferior.

This bad boy right here. 1600 Watts for 8 hrs on 1.1 gallon fuel,

price, for any heavy duty work, I'd deploy this.

Globalization, outsourcing when it started, was a major boon for big
corporations. Specifically for them bcz they had the structure to work
those wheels. So glob would give them an advantage against SMB, then
one could predict in the heydays of glob that once outsourcing started
to help SMB, it would seize to exist...

few years ago I started hearing Chinese factories taking orders from
such companies, "send a CAD model we'll produce X number of
-whatever-". Well now that's no advantage now for the corps is it?

And guess what, glob as we know it is ending.
