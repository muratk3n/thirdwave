"BMW R&D Chief Klaus Froehlich:

[Y]ou cannot electrify a heavy truck with batteries, because reducing the payload from 6 tons to 7 tons is absolute nonsense. With a single recharging station, you can refuel a fleet of 100 hydrogen-powered light trucks overnight. About 200 highway refueling stations could serve thousands of heavy trucks across Europe, which means that on the infrastructure side, this is feasible"

Func becomes better differentiable this way, with sig instead of
max. Nowadays automatic differentiation packages can diff anything
including max, but still, a friendly, symbolic diff ready func is a
good thing.

*2020-1-6 14:30:2*

---

Lit saz piecewise splines are implemented with `c0 + c1*max(0,x-a) +
c2*max(x-b) + ...`. U can get bunch of connected line this way
wiggling any way you want.. a,b are knots.

So `max` is just a switch. I thinks I can smootha dat, `def sig(x,a):
return (x-k)*1/(1+np.exp(-rho*(x-k)))`, little smooth func that flips
gentler instead of max, nam sayin'? Then `c0 + c1*sig(x,a) +
c2*sig(x-b) + ...`. Sheeee-iiit

Works really well. Even in parametrized form over `t`. But I cant find
uses of this anywhere.. I cant be the 1st jagoff who thought of this

nets.. It's for optimization)

If we can get fast payments done, there are gazillion
possibilities. Payments for artists can become extremely
efficient. Say I am listening to a song, *War*, I can send a payment
to that name, to that song, laser like. That name will be placeholder,
all $$ to that name is distributed to all stakeholders behind that
name. It could be Edwin Starr, the Tempations, James Brown, or Chris
Tucker and JChan for singing it that one time in a movie - I dont
care. People can argue among themselves in courts who needs to be part

Bam approach was abt cajoling Iran for a nuclear deal. Old allies
however freaked out and "out of nowhere" ISIS terror started - this is
when Soleimani was "fighting ISIS"-. Now nuke deal is gone, old allies
are new again, Iran is under pressure. Soleimani was now back fighting
US before he was killed. ISIS of course has magically disappeared.

"Induction heating occurs when a high frequency alternating current is
passed through a coil. Because of this, the induced magnetic field in
the surroundings is swinging rapidly, stirring polar particles
(particles that have a distinct plus and minus pole even if they’re
electrically neutral overall) in the field. This can result even in
ripping molecules apart (dissociation) and knocking electrons out of
their orbitals (ionization). The charged remnants are ions and
electrons, forming a plasma. Because of this, the device is called an
“inductive plasma generator” or IPG...

Generating a plasma without contact, the propellant cannot damage
e.g. electrodes. This allows a near arbitrary selection of gasses as
propellant, and therefore viable in-situ resource utilization
concepts. Even space station wastes could be fed to such a thruster"

Apparently it's possible to excite propellant molecules magnetically

I mean small. Cubesats are tiny. And it only works in vacuum (in
space, getting to space from Earth not possib). Still - cool.

Good choice Riksbank Sweden. We are back to Defcon 3.

Stop funding that joke of a "Nobel Prize" we could even go down to
Defcon 1.

"Sweden Ends Its Experiment.

Negative rates are the destruction of money, an economic aberration
based on the mistakes of many central banks and some of their
economists who start from a wrong diagnosis: the idea that economic
agents do not take more credit or invest more because they choose to
save too much and therefore saving must be penalized to stimulate the
economy... it is a ludicrous idea.

Inflation and growth are not low due to excess savings, but because of
excess debt, perpetuating overcapacity with low rates and high
liquidity and zombifying the economy by subsidizing the low
productivity and highly indebted sectors ...

Sweden launched its failed negative rate plan almost five years ago
and now reverses it due to the financial risks that are created. The
most interesting thing is that it reverses the policy of negative
rates precisely because of the risk of an economic slowdown because
the evidence shows that investment and consumption decisions do not
increase with financial repression"

Sounds pretty bad.

Overall how bad? I found this API site for financial data.
For Apple the data URL would be

https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3
/financials/income-statement/AAPL?period=quarter

The output text based a so-called JSON format. Useful stuff... For
TSLA YoY revenue

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json, pandas as pd
html = urlopen('https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/financials/income-statement/TSLA?period=quarter')
json_res = json.loads(html.read().decode('utf-8'))
res = []
for x in json_res['financials']:
     res.append((x['date'],float(x['Revenue'])))
df = pd.DataFrame(res)
df.columns=['Date','Rev']
df['revyoy'] = (df['Rev'] - df['Rev'].shift(-4)) / df['Rev'].shift(-4) * 100.0
print (df.head(1))
```

```text
         Date    ...       revyoy
0  2019-09-30    ...    -7.634818

Not necessarily. Digital basic income could create some new
options. DBI holders could contribute $ to a pool for instance which
can act as a lender to businesses. That credit will fuel growth,
create more services and goods, more money chasing after more
services, so-so inflation.

"If the ppl get digital income, and money base expands 4% annually
wouldnt that create a lot of inflation?"

"The best verdict on Game of Thrones came from one of its guest stars,
Ian McShane. With the nonchalance of an actor who spent the ’80s
making rent by playing a semimystical antiques dealer in a British
teatime drama, McShane declared that everyone needed to calm down
about George R. R. Martin’s epic saga. It was, after all, “only tits
and dragons.”The reaction from the HBO program’s more hard-core fans
was predictable outrage"
