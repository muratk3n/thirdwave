@NorthmanTrader

How fragile must our financial system be that it requires zero rates, $700B in QE, $500B in repos not even 4 weeks from all time highs and still it is not enough?

"@ClementYChow

[From a covid19 patient] Basically had a low grade fever for a few
days then a bad cough, that turned into respiratory failure. I came in
and they had to put me on high flow oxygen (3 times normal)...hence
ICU...

Important point: we really don‚Äôt know much about his virus. I‚Äôm young
and not high risk, yet I am in [the] ICU with a very severe case"

Too much money printed (through credit for useless shit) can also
cause yields to go to zero. This is bunch of f-ing money, where will
it go? Some went to bonds of course (price up yields down).

"Brave [creators of a private Web browser] has filed a formal GDPR
complaint against Google for infringing the GDPR ‚Äúpurpose limitation‚Äù
principle. Enforcement would be tantamount to a functional separation
of Google‚Äôs business...

The GDPR purpose limitation principle requires that organizations
internally ring-fence personal data and use it only for the narrow
purpose it was collected for. Brave‚Äôs evidence shows that Google‚Äôs
internal data free-for-all is unlawful"

This is incorrect. The latest death rate 7.3% is much larger than 1
divided by 700,000 (chances of getting hit by lightning)

No covid19 in Madagascar? Really?

Papua New Guinea: on my map PNG island had no corona on the east
(divided by straight line). The west had some color - so apparently
the Western part is Indonesia, the eastern part is PNG, the country.

Why do earlier primaries effect later primaries? Why did Clyburn's
endorsement matter so much? Dont people intelligently judge policies,
on their own, and decide?

No. People don't know __shit__. They are effected by others, especially
leaders. Rightfully so too. Do I know about dentristy? Bee-keeping? No.

Fauci sounds straight-up Brooklyn. Tuualking. Communicates direct,
sounds like Bernie actually.

The last name could suggest, there, a paisan. But he is more
Brooklyner than whatever fucktard immig label ppl might attach to
him. So he is like Bernie - who is Jewish :| Culture is shaped by
region - local, national. The mantras you mumble, some frickin beads u
play are irrelevant, including your parents' ethnicity.
