"@justinhendrix

One thing many people have hoped is that the warm weather may slow the
spread of coronavirus. But in Australia, where temperatures are still
in the 60s, 70s and 80s Farenheit, the virus is still spreading. As of
yesterday it is in all provinces"

Education should be built, from ground-up for async, disconnected,
offline model. Then, that material is supplied "online" sure, but it
could as well be delivered through a USB stick.

*2020-3-12 12:32:58*

"Offline online" approach is best. Class material becomes like a book,
visited, revisited as necessary but recorded once (and maintained as
necessary). Material should include code as well. See
[Prof](https://twitter.com/mluebbecke/status/1237752496023646210).

People are so locally minded (and that's fine). There has been
constant intnl news abt cov19, there were cases all around Tiggerland
but nothing in Tiggerland. Clearly the inbred officials were hiding
it. No peep from people tho.. It wasnt until gov announced the 1st
case, then tigger started talking about it, see ppl at the markets
etc. It's important to realize this - people __rely__ on governance,
nationally. Especially at times of despair.

The "store front" of the prog left became "too diverse", too
non-American in terms of others' perception. There are some fine
people there, no doubt, most are culturally American, but the message
should not be "multi-racial" which communicates "diversity for the f-k
of it", it is "we don't give an eff what your ethnicity is". Have to
strike a balance. Too multi-racial can put off whites, too Latin might
put off blacks.

The left needs to drop its need for orgasm from people agreeing with
them (also the turning-off they get from disagreement). "Agreement" on
issues might not equate to electoral success. Watch hot button issues,
even create them, get elected. Then implement issues and be judged on
the success of them.

I do understand the urgency around this though since so much got
diluted over the years due to errant, rabid centrism.

Plus voter mobilization is key part of the process, as in energizing
them to go to the voting booth. Issue based atomic polls might not

Atomic issues did not matter much, M4A, soc security, previous

Another point here is IN came to the possession of bunch of paper to
write on. IMO this was key - in computer science the only difference
between two computing machines, finite-state automata, and the Turing
machine is an (infinite) tape. The latter is the basis of all
computing, more powerful, because it can write and
__remember__. Essentially modern computing, and perhaps human adv
thinking, is largely based on writing, we can achieve by [a
lot](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/research/pdf/grad.html) by writing,
going back to it, revising, extending.

So the plague at the time helped Newton become what he is. Plague was
raging outside he was studying. If this WuFlu gets worse maybe we'll
get some good scientists out of it?

Gleick, *Isaac Newton*: "[Then] came the epidemic.  Three men in
London succumbed in a single house; by January the plague, this
disease of population density, was spreading from parish to parish,
hundreds dying each week, then thousands. Before the outbreak ran its
course, in little more than a year, it killed one of every six
Londoners...

The colleges of Cambridge began shutting down.  Fellows and students
dispersed into the countryside.  Newton returned home. He built
bookshelves and made a small study for himself. He opened the nearly
blank thousand-page commonplace book [empty notebook] he had inherited
from his stepfather and named it his Waste Book. He began filling it
with reading notes. These mutated seamlessly into original research.
He set himself problems; considered them obsessively; calculated
answers, and asked new questions. He pushed past the frontier of
knowledge (though he did not know this). The plague year was his
transfiguration. Solitary and almost incommunicado, he became the
world‚Äôs paramount mathematician"
