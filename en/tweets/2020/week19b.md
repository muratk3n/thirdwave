"A University of Central Florida researcher and his team have developed
an advanced new rocket-propulsion system once thought to be
impossible.

The system, known as a rotating detonation rocket engine, will allow
upper stage rockets for space missions to become lighter, travel
farther, and burn more cleanly"

NYT: "The problem, Garrett added, is bigger than Trump and older than
his presidency. America has never been sufficiently invested in public
health. The riches and renown go mostly to physicians who find new and
better ways to treat heart disease, cancer and the like. The big
political conversation is about individuals‚Äô access to health care.

But what about the work to keep our air and water safe for everyone,
to design policies and systems for quickly detecting outbreaks,
containing them and protecting entire populations? Where are the
rewards for the architects of that?

Garrett recounted her time at Harvard. 'The medical school is all
marble, with these grand columns,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe school of public
health is this funky building, the ugliest possible architecture, with
the ceilings falling in.'"

'That‚Äôs America?' I asked.

'That‚Äôs America,' she said.

"It is a well-kept secret, but we know the answer to life, the universe
and everything. It‚Äôs not 42 ‚Äì it‚Äôs 1/137.

This immutable number determines how stars burn, how chemistry happens
and even whether atoms exist at all. Physicist Richard Feynman, who
knew a thing or two about it, called it 'one of the greatest damn
mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no
understanding'"

QUESTION

Given that 1) people stopped going to restaurants, 2) they kept
eating, & 3) farmers are dumping produce, dairy, meat owing to a
surplus nobody wants, could it be that restaurants, (because of their
need to maintain variety & excess quantities) waste a looot of food?"

It's true. That's why I changed my publishing system, all content you
now see are the product of text files, typed in a very simple markdown
format, that I "check in" to my own local code repository. I sync that
repo with a remote one, to publish, which has an added web page
generation ability from that remote repo from markdown, but that func
can be replicated elsewhere. The point is I own all the base
content. It's all based on simple files.

Reading Snowden's book made me remember the good old times of the Net
- I am also very much a product of that era as he is.

Snowden, *Permanent Record* - "Now, it was the creative Web that
collapsed [after 90s], as countless beautiful, difficult,
individualistic websites were shuttered. The promise of convenience
led people to exchange their personal sites‚Äîwhich demanded constant
and laborious upkeep‚Äîfor a Facebook page and a Gmail account. The
appearance of ownership was easy to mistake for the reality of it. Few
of us understood it at the time, but none of the things that we‚Äôd go
on to share would belong to us anymore."

There is nothing to be proud of for the descendants of these "ancient
civilizations" - the Han, Ottocuck, Egypt, Sassanid, Rome... These
were agro-centric centralized mafia empires, through their
peasant/tax/opress cycle created a toxic culture that still lingers,
like a bad fart, which is impeding the progress of their descendants.

Lets's look at data. We compare China, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Egypt,
Iran vs others.

GDP per capita, them vs others (data from World Bank,
[GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita),
[Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)),[CSV](gdpw.csv))


```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('gdpw.csv')
df['gdpw'] = df.gdp * df.population
anc = ['China','Italy','Turkey','Greece','Egypt','Iran']
dfc1 = df[df.country.isin(anc)]
dfc2 = df[df.country.isin(anc) == False ]
print ('Mafia', np.round(dfc1.gdpw.sum() / dfc1.population.sum(),2))
print ('Others', np.round(dfc2.gdpw.sum() / dfc2.population.sum(),2))
```

```text
Mafia 10069.93
Others 11739.59
```

Significant difference.

Let's look at democratic progress, them versus the entire world,

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('p4v2018.xls')
df = df[df.polity > -10.0] # remove junk code -88
print ('Mafia',np.round(df[df.country.isin(anc)].polity.mean(),2))
print ('Others',np.round(df[df.country.isin(anc) == False].polity.mean(),2))
```

```text
Mafia -0.53
Others 0.44
```

Throught the *entire* 100+ years the Polity keeps track of, "ancient"
countries did worse democratically than the rest.

"Oh but things would've changed recently". Ok, let's look at
that.

```python
df3 = df[df.year == 2018]
print ('Mafia',np.round(df3[df3.country.isin(anc)].polity.mean(),2))
print ('Others',np.round(df3[df3.country.isin(anc) == False].polity.mean(),2))
```

```
Mafia -0.33
Others 4.73
```

Mafia improved only __tiny__ bit while still being in the red (< 0),
while the rest made significant advances.
