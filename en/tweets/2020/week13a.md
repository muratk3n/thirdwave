cause serious damage. Limit access.

Billionaires are on a basic income if you think abt it. Most of them
arent really that smart, their money makes money. Get to a critical
mass with some chicanery, off you go.. I mean who is a million times
smarter than the next guy? Noone. Then that free money is a
handout. Factor in all the regulatory, legal framework that allows
them to keep it..
