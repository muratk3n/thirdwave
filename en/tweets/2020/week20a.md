Thought leaders should not think at cultural level of course. Cultural
thinking is for morons (and regular ppl who are morons on much of
politics which is a craft, a trade).

Politicians play this game a lot (part of what I call 'closing'). Do
not lose hope on democracy however; ppl vote on very general things,
and their well-being is one of them, if econ goes bad, they die, that
is reptilian. Fight or flight trumps culture.

Maybe Reps decided the outcome of COVID can be politically
damaging, so it was time to press some buttons to create cultural
divisions, to change the focus, shift blame. What better way to do
that then to rekindle some culture codes? If there is cultural
tug-of-war between prohibition and "freedom", you just reframe the
COVID situation around staying-at-home, working-not-working around
prohibition-freedom axis, and you got yourself a nice little bruhaha.

In terms of effectiveness the hierarchy in the brain goes 1) reptilian
brain 2) culture codes 3) intellect. You press a button at the second
level, intellect will be overtaken.

Rapaille, *The Culture Code*: "Life is tension.  Everything we
experience in life lies somewhere on an axis between two extremes.
One cannot truly know pleasure without knowing pain.  One cannot
legitimately feel joy without having felt sorrow.  The degree to which
we feel an experience depends on where that experience lies on the
axis (a little painful, overwhelmingly joyful, and so on)...

Similar tensions define cultures. Every culture is composed of an
endless number of archetypes and of the tensions between each
archetype and an opposing one.  For example, one of the primary
tensions in the American culture is the one between freedom and
prohibition. We consider freedom an inalienable right. We have fought
numerous wars to protect it, and our citizens are willing to die to
maintain it. At the same time, however, our culture is very strongly
inclined toward prohibition. We believe we shouldnâ€™t drink too much,
play too much, or exhibit too much wealth.  While the axis itself
never changes, where a culture stands on a particular axis varies from
era to era.  At various times in our history, for example, our culture
has found itself in different places on the freedomâ€“prohibition axis
(leaning heavily toward prohibition in the 1920s and far in the
opposite direction during the late 1960s and early 1970s), but the
opposing force was always evident (bootleggers in the 1920s, the
Silent Majority in the latter period). This tension is a constant in
our culture and it helps make our culture what it is"

Due to prohibition-freedom culture tug-of-war probably.

That trip is 4200 km long. It used 9160.8kWh, a Nexo tank being 210
kWh, that's like 43 tanks.

"Solar / H2 boat Energy Observer's made a trip from St. Petersburg in
Russia to Spitsbergen in Norway on August 10th. During the 24-day
jaunt, the boat produced 9,160.8kWh of energy, 52 percent of which
came from the sun... Of the total power, 59 percent propelled the
boat, with the remaining 41 percent going to life support"

"@LaurentLessard

'The cubic model' for forecasting COVID-19 deaths has been in the
news lately.

Cubics (and polynomials in general) are a very bad choice of model for
this situation. Let's talk about why. 1/n

Cubics are functions that look like: f(x) = a + b x + c xÂ² + d xÂ³
'Fitting a cubic model' means choosing (a,b,c,d) so that f(x) is
approximately equal to the deaths on day x for the data you've
got. The hope is that this f could then be used to predict future
deaths.

A key property of cubics (and polynomials in general) is that they
grow really fast when x is large. Depending on whether d>0 or d<0 in
the expression for f(x), you will get f(x) going to plus or minus
infinity, respectively, as x gets larger.

This feature makes cubics an inappropriate model, because we expect
the number of deaths to eventually settle down to zero. Cubics can
NEVER do this. So no matter what cubic we use, its future predictions
will eventually be nonsensical. It's just a matter of when'"

Thank you planktons

"But did you know that most of the oxygen you breathe comes from
organisms in the ocean?

Thatâ€™s rightâ€”more than half of the oxygen you breathe comes from
marine photosynthesizers, like phytoplankton and seaweed. Both use
carbon dioxide, water and energy from the sun to make food for
themselves, releasing oxygen in the process"

Way to go GW! Medical knowledge helped the founding of US. How'bout that?

"George Washington's military genius is undisputed. Yet American
independence must be partially attributed to a strategy for which
history has given the infamous general little credit: his
controversial medical actions. Traditionally, the Battle of Saratoga
is credited with tipping the revolutionary scales. Yet the health of
the Continental regulars involved in battle was a product of the
ambitious initiative Washington began earlier that year ... On the 6th
of January 1777, George Washington wrote to Dr. William Shippen Jr.,
ordering him to inoculate all of the forces that came through
Philadelphia"

Open sourcing the trace app; good idea.

"Trace Together is an app by the Singapore government that has already
been installed by 620,000 people. This contact tracing app can
identify people who have come within 2 metres of COVID-19 positive
patient for at least half an hour using wireless Bluetooth technology.

In a bid to fight the global coronavirus pandemic, the Singapore
government is now making the code for this app open-source"
