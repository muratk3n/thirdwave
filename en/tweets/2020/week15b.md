# Tweets - Week 15b

It's crazy - voters' needs are intensely immediate... In the Prez
election [prediction](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/05/stats.html#prez)
if I use GDP YoY growth (Q2 of election yr compared to Q2 of last
year) I lose an entire 5% in $R^2$, that is, a worse model. If I use
annualized growth, that is Q2 GDP compared to *previous* quarter,
annualized, then the model gets better. Q2 is of course the last
freaking quarter right before the "endgame" of the election itself.

Voters are like "what have u done for me __ta-day__ biiaatch!" Muuney,
now! Last year, seasonal, f--ing cyclic, roundabout, some other
bullshit - they dont care. Bring the goods, pronto.

Still see some being adamantly agajnst red meat. Yeah go ahead, do
that. I'll eat mine than I'll kick your ass. I'll kick your ass and
take your wife. I'll rename your children, Eenie, Meenie, Mo. Or A, B,
C.. however I like it.. Then you'll understand you made big
mistake. But by then it will be too late. You already had your ass
kicked. I got the ho, I got the food.

[A poultry producer company] Lynca’s first focus was to install an
efficient and flexible refrigeration system that could handle its
primary duties (chilling and freezing of meat) reliably and
efficiently. To that end, EP designed an ammonia system with a
capacity of 792kW (225.2TR) capacity that allowed Lynca to almost
double its production within the limitations of its electrical
supply. With this system, it managed to replace some of the simplex
units; the rest were later replaced with an HFC multiplex system on a
cooling-as-a-service (CaaS) model.

There were legit reports on some success; he got wind of it,
shared. Then the press naturally jumped on him bcz "nah, this clown
couldn't have picked something remotely working!". Maybe that's
exactly why Trump partly shared it, to create bunch of kerkuffle but
now the drug became part of the food fight. This stuff shouldn't be
discussed in this manner.. If it is cleared by top dogs in science,
use it.

To summarize: you can't simply pull out money out of your ass and have
it be a positive effect on government level, there is a point the
trick loses its effect.

Sure crisis is a different situation.

US, as the printer of the world's reserve currency is a different
beast as well.

Noone is arguing not giving money to who needs it the most. If u
exceed the ceiling of debt effectiveness, then go to the rich, and tax
their ass.

"Oh but don't you know governments can print money for
themselves". Again, different for US. Everyone else has to worry about
inflation, and the price of their currency. We can't make coarse
statements about austerity, money printing wout refering to
thresholds, inst situation of each counntry.

Butkus et al: "[W]e found a significant U-shaped debt-growth link when
estimated in the sample of countries with to some extent similar
institutional quality as measured by government
effectiveness. However, counties with high (low) government
effectiveness can start facing negative impact at very different
ratios of public debt to GDP. Depending on estimation technique, debt
turning point varies from 46% to 229% and from 8% to 145% of GDP in
countries with respectively high and low government effectiveness.
Such extreme variation is sharply reduced if we take trade balance
into account. Relaying on the trade and budget deficit relationship
(“twin deficit” hypothesis) and expenditure multiplier effect, in this
paper we assume that besides government effectiveness, a trade balance
is another crucial factor determining debt threshold level. While
exact debt turning point still varies depending on estimation method,
when we consider both factors, that is, government effectiveness and
trade balance, all specifications confirm the main idea, that
countries with better quality of governance and lower level of trade
deficit have higher debt threshold level"
