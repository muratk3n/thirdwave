If you think u can parachute on the Dem nomination, u are even dumber

speech at the 92 Dem convention, so he might have contributed to the
election of Bill F-ing Clinton with his "oratory".

It's that parallel universe story.. The moment I saw it I knew it was
a crock. Then I waited to see who'd come down on it. Peter Woit didn't
disappoint.

"I never thought I would see this happen: a university PR department
correcting media hype about its research. You might have noticed¬†this
comment here a week ago, about a flurry of media hype about neutrinos
and parallel universes. ..  The main offender was New Scientist, "

Sweet

"The National Science Foundation (NSF) would get a sweeping
remake‚Äîincluding a new name, a huge infusion of cash, and
responsibility for maintaining U.S. global leadership in
innovation‚Äîunder bipartisan bills that have just been introduced in
both houses of Congress.

Many scientific leaders are thrilled that the bills call for giving
NSF an additional $100 billion over 5 years to carry out its new
duties. But some worry the legislation, if enacted, could compromise
NSF‚Äôs historical mission to explore the frontiers of knowledge without
regard to possible commercial applications"
