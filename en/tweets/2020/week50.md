# Week 50

Haha.. they say architecturally the GPU borrows ideas from the
Connection Machine of 80s. I'll always remember CM through Feynman's
involvement [in it](https://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/).
Feynman.. This guy was everywhere.

---

That' true. And simple-in-the-small wins over in the long-run, in
terms of concurrency. Many top supercomputers in the world these days
use GPUs. And its funny it all started from the graphics community.

"GPUs and CPUs are architecturally very different devices. CPUs are
designed for running a small number of potentially quite complex
tasks. GPUs are designed for running a large number of quite simple
tasks"

I never discounted the possibility, [see UFOs](2015/08/ufo.md).

Lab grown meat.. so stem cells are harvested from cows, muscle stem
cells multiplies (grown) to trillions, making meat?

Then u still need *some* cows around to harvest stem cells from, but
not as many cows as we have today? That's not bad.

"On December 3, 2020, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees
completed their conference on the¬†Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense
Authorization Act. We read all 4,517 pages so you don‚Äôt have to. The
Act includes numerous important sections on Asia. One of the most
notable is the the creation of a Pacific Deterrence Initiative
(Sec. 1251), which aims to bolster deterrence against China while also
reassuring allies and partners. But there are many other provisions
Asia watchers should note, including sections related to U.S. regional
strategy, Asian alliances, and competition with China across a variety
of departments and agencies"

the Grattan Institute (a nonprofit think tank supported by the state

'Ideally, lockdowns are only done once and done well,' the proposal‚Äôs

zero is to reduce the risk of ‚Äòyo-yoing‚Äô between virus flare-ups and
further lockdowns to contain them.'‚Äù

Calmer, less flash is great

Saw on ABC, the host seemed ready to jump on the guest for perceived
sleight on labor, there is less flash for one thing, which is great,
and the general attitude doesnt seem to be obnoxiously capitalistic,

Toffler, The Third Wave: "Built on the factory model, mass education
taught basic reading, writing, and arithmetic, a bit of history and
other subjects. This was the 'overt curriculum.' But beneath it lay an
invisible or 'covert curriculum' that was far more basic. It
consisted‚Äîand still does in most industrial nations‚Äîof three courses:
one in punctuality, one in obedience, and one in rote, repetitive
work. Factory labor demanded workers who showed up on time, especially
assembly-line hands. It demanded workers who would take orders from a
management hierarchy without questioning. And it demanded men and
 women prepared to slave away at machines or in offices, performing
brutally repetitious operations"

Pro debt / anti debt... The right answer depends on the (ideologically
distinct) party. Oscillation btw the two will lead to an optimal final
IMO, in the long run..but neither is an illegitimate position. See
[Austerity](../../2020/07/austerity.md).

---

There is some good culture / precedent / regulation around DOJ. Like
Prez cant fire ppl directly but appoint ppl who could, in theory? But
then those ppl are hemmed in with regulation, which they can change,
but its hard. POTUS can always fire for refusal of firing others, but
then you get special prosecutors jammed up your ass, by the courtesy
of Congress.

And the charge cycle... How many times can the said "efficient"
charge/recharge be done? 1000 times? Then what? "Recycle the battery",
having to deal with all that frickin acid..? No thank you.

---

We cant ship batteries easily, their energy density is too low. Energy
needs to be shipped to it. Its misinformed proponents are all about
"the grid" for this reason. But the grid is inefficient itself, so
even combined with "efficient" monkey, the whole system is as good as
fossil.

"We'll update the grid", then we have another problem which is not
enough lithium to go around. Existing reserves can only cover 10% of
today's storage needs, 1% projected. That is one rare monkey.

---

It is too specialized, for one. Widely used systems need to be build
around agile, common components. Batteries are like that circus monkey
performing that one trick very well, but we need a Swiss army knife
not a circus monkey. The animal cld be fine, rare, handles one case
superbly. But how about many other tasks?

"Batteries can store and allow energy retrieval efficiently. What is wrong with that?"
