Political Islam usually degrades into caliphatism as in Ottomuffs,
similar to the centralized, managed Christianity (Catholicism) of Rome
an outgrowth of widespread peasantry and its parasitic mafia - sorry,
empire. The left aspect of religion is quashed. So it makes sense to
keep organized religion at bay, away from state functions.

"Keeping track of freight on thousands of railcars along thousands of
miles of track, maintaining rail beds, keeping engines and cars
repaired, overseeing thousands of employees, and ensuring safe passage
required a new kind of organizational model. Economic historian Alfred
Chandler points out that railroads were the first modern business
enterprise to separate ownership from management. No single family
could underwrite the huge capital costs of building a railroad. So, in
the 1850s, European investment houses began financing
U.S. railroads.60 The operation of the railroads was put under the
stewardship of a new class of professional managers. They created the
precursor of the modern corporation, a centralized, hierarchical
command-and-control mechanism made up of critical decision makers at
the top of the pyramid and middle managers at various rungs who were
responsible for specific day-to-day functions of the organization and
accountable to higher-ups for overall guidance"

"Access to oil became even more important during World War II. Indeed,
the entire strategy of the war revolved around controlling vital oil
supplies...

[Hitler] set its sights on a two-pronged approach to securing oil:
first, developing a synthetic-fuel industry at home; and second,
pushing into a war with Russia to secure access to the rich oil fields
at Baku in central Asia"

for review. 40 out of 41 did not send me the right data...

21 of them were just withdrawn without providing raw data. 19 of them
were rejected due to insufficient raw data ...

I cannot help suspecting that some (or many) of them, from the
beginning, did not have the right raw data that match the results
shown"

"In order to (inconsistently) enforce this labyrinth of red tape,
Bloomberg effectively turned the police into a task force on petty
vice, sending them to write up people for harmless offenses (a move
their union loudly protested). In a 2004 piece for Vanity Fair,
Christopher Hitchens set out on a crime spree across New York where he
tried to break as many of these enforced regulations as possible. This
meant not just lighting up in a bar, but sitting on a milk crate ($105
fine for a Bronx man), feeding pigeons (summons for an 86-year-old),
and riding a bike without both feet on the pedals. Strangely, though
considered crimes against humanity in Bloombergistan, these particular
infractions had nothing to do with public health. What they did have
to do with was fines, which were then used to fill city coffers,
authoritarianism in the service of deficit cutting. This enabled
Bloomberg to boast about his fiscal responsibility even as he presided
over a hefty expansion of the city‚Äôs budget"

Last [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2404) I saw on this said
conciousness is not required for the so-called collapse of the wave
function.

Corallary: if this thing "collapses" even for inanimate objects, that
would increase the likelihood of what we see being one version of the
world. Even if you believe collapse is happening, it is happening all
the time, so there aint much motherf--ing wave left to have your
motherf-ing multiverses in.

Reality can still be warped of course, generated from some data
structure, graph, tensor, etc but still, real. As in, not subjective.

It's not just about the methane Bloomy.. they use potable water for the fracking process which is wasted, and more, what comes out is toxic. If this toxic water seeps into ground it will poison its nearby area for decades.

"Ocean-going ships could be powered by ammonia within the decade as the
shipping industry takes action to curb carbon emissions.

The chemical - the key ingredient of fertilisers - can be burned in
ships‚Äô engines in place of polluting diesel.

The industry hopes ammonia will help it tackle climate change, because
it burns without CO2 emissions...

But it notes that the near ubiquitous use of ammonia for agriculture
has conveniently generated a global network of ports where the
chemical is traded or stored.

That means the infrastructure for storing chilled ammonia as a
shipping fuel already exists. In the USA, for instance, one existing
ammonia pipeline runs for 2,000 miles...

The engine designer Man Energy Solutions is making a two-stroke
ammonia-powered engine it hopes will be ready by 2024.

The firm‚Äôs spokesman, Peter Kirkeby, told the BBC: ‚ÄúWe see a very big
interest from the market in ammonia as a fuel ‚Äì even though there are
challenges.

'We expect the first ships fuelled with ammonia will be existing
tankers that are already transporting ammonia for fertiliser. They
know how to handle it.'"
