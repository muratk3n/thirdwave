From US Energy department [energy.gov](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/350)

"A tax credit of up to $8,000 is available for the purchase of qualified light-duty fuel cell vehicles, depending on the vehicle's fuel economy"

There doesnt seem to be any limits on how many cars are supported.

Credit card debt nearly doubled since the 08 crisis. Now it is over 4
__trillion__. Did ppl's income double? No. 

That is 13K $ debt per person - man, woman, and child, where most ppl
cannot come up with $500 for an emergency. The interest rate on this
debt is not favorable - per @RaoulGMI. So it cannot be paid. Someone
will burn. In a post 08 world, I dont think it will be ordinary people
this time.

If he makes prez, it will get ugly.. You will be counting the fat on
your chicken by the micrograms, if you exceed your quota you will be
mowed down by rapid machine gun fire from a rooftop, or a nearby

ground with your chicken sandwich splattered around, and you'll have
to beg to the drone not to kill you, pledging profusely to remain in
your fat quota. If the software believes you, you will

Instead of looking for f-ing universes in multiples, wouldn't it be
better to build upon "space-as-an-illusion" idea - a route already
hinted at by Einstein who showed space-time can bend? Take the next
step, show space is not primary but emergent, and show QM falls out of
this as an approximation.

But no, let's make a struggling actor's job harder.. Now not only do
they have to play the hero, but also the evil twin, in the same
episode from a different universe. This is exploitation. They are now
working double time, the goatee itches, and there is always that
annoying draft up the crack of your ass thanks to the leather pant
with the butt cut-out; an indispensible part of the evil twin
visual.

Right - if space is emergent, an illusion, that solves nonlocality of
entanglement. There is no "spooky action at a distance" because there
is no distance.

Smolin: "If locality is not absolute, if it is the contingent result
of dynamics, it will have defects and exceptions. And indeed, this
appears to be the case: how else are we to understand quantum
nonlocality, particularly nonlocal entanglement? These, I would
hypothesize, are remnants of the spaceless relations inherent in the
primordial stage, before space emerges"

*2020-2-10 19:7:37*

---

Smolin: "I drew a lesson from a survey of approaches to quantum
foundations, which is that space and time cannot both be
fundamental. Only one can be present at the deepest level of
understanding; the other must be emergent and contingent. This seems
ultimately to be forced on us by the nonlocality of entanglement,
which leads to a tension between realist approaches to quantum
mechanics and special relativity. The latter unifies space and time
into spacetime, which the experimental tests of Bell’s restriction
suggest is transcended in individual quantum processes. I would then
like to suggest that the tension is resolved by making one of the pair
space/time fundamental, while the other is an emergent and approximate
description, ultimately a kind of illusion. For many reasons, some
described here, some the subject of earlier books,1 I choose to focus
on the hypothesis that time is fundamental, while space is emergent."

Interesting... I'd say let the fossil mofos live a little, but all
that flaring biz in Texas was truly infuriating. If methane leaks,
flaring, and other side effects can be regulated, then blue.

One good thing with blue would be enticing Russians to switch over to
it, but they also have sunlight don't they? And an obscene amount of
landmass.

If not, hammer time. Green Blitzkrieg.

Great. Now let's add the automagic-money-creation-per-user,
digital-basic-income feature so money base expands, everyone has money
for basics, we can then have the digital currency of the future.

Nano on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_\(cryptocurrency\)):
"Nano is a decentralized, open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency
released under the FreeBSD License. It facilitates feeless and
fast-settling transactions without intermediaries by utilizing a
distributed ledger. Nano’s goal is to address the scalability
limitations of Bitcoin, which can result in restrictive fees and
increased transaction confirmation times when under load. Unlike other
cryptocurrencies, Nano does not rely on mining or transaction fees,
and transactions typically confirm in 0.25-10 seconds.

The Nano protocol functions by employing a block-lattice data
structure, a unique implementation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
in addition to a voting-based consensus algorithm called Open
Representative Voting. Accounts on the Nano network each have their
own blockchain, which enables transactions to be quickly processed
asynchronously. The transactions are then voted on by user-selected
representative nodes before being immutably confirmed"
