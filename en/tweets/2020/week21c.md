Yes. It's rare but happens. Some people are wired so differently they
will not fit in their home country. Clotaire Rapaille says in that
case, the solution is simple, get a plane ticket and leave (he was
born French and could not live there).

Being aware of them will help. Another way is through advanced levels
of certain types of meditation, the hard-core kind, bcz they
ultimately lead to "the death of the socially learned self". You cld
burn a fuse tho, watch out. Krishna almost died. Krishnamurti did
okay, but he had many others helping him. Some high level teachers
even, tough mofos spent a few years not being able to keep food down
and lived on freaking jello, yoghurt. This shit can kill you. Beware.

I wouldn't f--k with democracies son. They'll whoop ur ass. They are
[better at war](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2016/11/why-is-democracy-better.html#war),
for very rational reasons.

Conversely one could say countries with less democracies will be worse
at war. Because they know they can hide, linger in a place, a region,
they would not mobilize to end the fight in the first place. If your
press sucks, you dont fear backlash on press, you fight like a
cobsucker that you are.

Bass: "On May 22, China's leaders will convene for their annual
People's Congress, during which they will discuss the status of Hong
Kong and whether to push forward with their rebuffed attempts to
impose upon that special jurisdiction the laws and circumscribed
rights of mainland China. If they do so, America and Britain will push
back‚Äîwith lasting consequence"

"Since the pandemic started, 27 million Americans have lost their
employer-based health insurance. Instead of covering the uninsured
through Medicare or Medicaid, Democrats decided it would be better to
pay COBRA premiums through January for people who have lost their
health insurance. COBRA is expensive and wouldn‚Äôt help Americans who
were already uninsured -- but the move would deliver more revenue to
the health care industry that wants the governmentto pay top-dollar to
keep people on the insurance plans they just lost"

Hah, that's true; left to right, and they are also top to bottom
higher voltage to lower.

Book about electronics: "Western civilization invented electronics and
writes from left to right. You read from left to right and,
culturally, more things happen from left to right. Electronics is no
different, so it is common to start with the source of the
electricity‚Äîthe battery or power supply on the left‚Äîand then work our
way from left to right across the diagram"
