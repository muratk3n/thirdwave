The new Picard show: I like how Picard was dismissive of the pyramids

Not sure if they r fighting renewables. Switch to that will be a legal
matter pretty soon. Maybe they are trying to squeeze as much profits
out of their fossil in the time left, on their own. US should've never
been in this shit anyway after their Peak Oil moment. It behooves
(very happy I get to use this word finally) US to find, develop
