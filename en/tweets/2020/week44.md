# Week 44

They discovered a method to produce a cheap catalyst that performs as
well as current methods, but based on tungsten.

"[E]lectrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as one of the
most important and sustainable processes for the hydrogen
production. Because of the low HER kinetics, it is necessary to use
high efficiency electrocatalysts to increase the overall process
efficiency. ...

Here, we report a simple and scalable plasma dynamic synthesis method
to form composite containing the single-crystalline nanosized cubic
tungsten carbide embedded in the carbon matrix (WC 1-x @C), which was
studied in HER both in the pure form and modified with some Pt by wet
impregnation method. It was found that even by adding 1 wt % platinum,
it is possible to significantly increase the catalytic activity of the
WC 1-x @C composite, while with the addition of 10% platinum allows
reaching almost the same properties as for commercial Pt/C sample"

These guys are developing a capsule technology to carry H2 to
whereever it's needed, especially for aviation needs. Good company to watch.

There is no comparison. H2 storage capacity is nearly limitless. If
there is water, we can get H2. Double the panel capacity double the
fuel. As simple as that.

"How does storage of H2 vs bats compare?"

How to understand a certain country with dumb ni--rs at the helm..
You start with a child. What does a child want? Wants to do grown-up
things, right. Drive like one, be like one.

<img width="340" src="https://cdn.cdnparenting.com/articles/2018/04/578115136-H.jpg"/>

But if the child type is dysfunctional, s/he wont know what those
grown-up things are, will instead do things that *appear* grown-up,
like this kid, with imaginary steering wheel, and make car sounds
"wroomm wrooom". In gov that'll be vevy vevy big bridges, vevy vevy
big wars... wout knowing whether these things are useful or not. This
is the sad truth.

They are very similar. With golf you sorta walk around too, like
regular daily life chill, then you go to a certain point, stop,
concenrate, strain.. strain.. Boom!

That's exactly like taking a shit.

"You say golf is similar to a number two. How so?"

I had many spirited debates about censorship in the TYT studio, I was
warning that being pro-censorship will always come back to bite the
left even harder. Reminder: No matter how much you hate someone who is
speaking, the antidote to bad speech is more speech, not censorship.

Making something float is much easier than making it sink. Calcs for a
platform... 3x2x8 meter design, with two stacks of empty barrels in
it, pour concrete over it, put a **ton** of weight on top, this
conrete slab would still float. 

Barrel, 0.16 m^3, concrete density 2400 kg / m3.

```python
w = 3; h = 2; l = 8
concw = (w*h*l - w*1.2*l) * 2400
concv = w*h*l
ow = 1000.0
"%0.2f, %0.2f" % (concw+ow, concv*1000.0)
```

Out[1]: '47080.00, 48000.00'

"Recycling lithium" is a non-starter for another reason. Reserves are
limited, as in insufficient, and since recycling does not magically
create new reserves, the main problem remains unresolved. Not enough
fucking lithium.

Trek isn't about the "Federation" necessarily either.. How do these
fools at Bad Reboot (a JJ outfit) watch these shows? With eyes closed?
They seem to have perfected the "superficial pay homage" move, e.g. in
*Into the Darkness* Khan says "my name is Khan" veery deliberately, BR
is like ok, u remember that right, I pressed that button now we are
okay? That was cool right..? Like it's a fan thing..? It's not a fan
thing. Roddenberry's creation is the whole package, not some building,
or some word you pay random homage to.

Earth surface area (including sea) 510.1 million km¬≤.

How much area for 1 person?

```python
area = ( 510.1  / (7.5 * 1e3) * 1e6  ) 
print ("%.2f m2" %  area )
print ("side %.2f m" %  np.sqrt(area) )
```

```text
68013.33 m2
side 260.79 m
```

Not too wide of an area.. a square with one side 260 meters..

Lota people.

I cannot believe post 911 was spent on such shoddy-ass solutions on

spreading democracy itself. At least to the level it itself has.
