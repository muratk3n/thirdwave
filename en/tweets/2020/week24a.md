Y'all notice how all of your 'libertarian' friends on social media
ain't been saying shit? Like, they should be anti-cop because
freedom. But they just can't bring themselves to acknowledge that
black lives matter because being a libertarian is just cool ranch
white supremacy"

"Jon Hunt, Toyota‚Äôs head of commercialisation of FCEV cars, told Auto
Express that manufacturing a lithium-ion battery for an electric car
is a 'very energy-intensive' process.

'As an example ... in order to produce [a 100kWh battery] battery, it
will take around 20 tonnes of CO2,' he said. 'A typical battery lasts
for 150,000 miles, so that equates to around 83g/km of CO2'

Are they? Or are they essential for luxurious services to continue

"We've seen delivery people are essential"

Yes.  With organized farming ppl worked for themselves, farmed their
own land, work depended on seasons, self-employment. Industrial age,
had "wage earners", who worked on atomized, small pieces of big
assignments, cogs in a machine, almost everyone worked for someone
else. We'll see what follows next in a post-industrial society.

(Postindustrial doesn't mean there is no industrial production, just
like there is still agriculture in a post-agro world)

"Should work change depending on tech?"

---

So many junk buzzwords in one sentence. The sol does nor lie in these
single-layer paint job tech solutions. Tech, if used, must be the
basis something drastically new, or it will not cause big
change. Third Wave society will not be Second Wave "modern" society
with some tech sprinkled on top.

Freud's methods are riddled with mistakes. Go with Jungian
psychology. He was the better thinker, his followers are still
producing good work; Myers-Briggs is an extension to Jung. So is

Interesting. Deeper structure concept always piques my interest.

Some say underly struct is a graph.. Fluids, equally awesome.

really behaves like a fluid; maybe it¬†is¬†a fluid.'"

Renaissance science is deeply tied with the age of exploration.

Accurate clocks were built to geolocate.

First modern sci grant was for a better clock in UK.

Guess who set at the commitee for that research -- Issac F..ing Newton.

"Susskind urged me to study string theory, too, but I‚Äôm not taking that
advice. First of all, string theory looks¬†more like a dead end now
than ever. Moreover, it would take far too long to learn‚Äîat least six
years of graduate-level study, one of my quantum advisers
estimated--and my old brain would probably never grasp it.¬†Edward
Witten, whom some say is the smartest physicist since Newton, told me
that when he read early papers on string theory in the 1970s, he found
them ‚Äúopaque.‚Äù (String theory‚Äôs hardness could explain its
persistence. Those who master it can‚Äôt admit they have wasted their
time on a dead end.)"
