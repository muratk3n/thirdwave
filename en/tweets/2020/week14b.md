So 90% of the crap in the global economy is utterly useless: nobody
needs 162 varieties of barbie dolls, or 68 brands of shitty laptops.

Standardize: a few models, done well, durable, for everything. Good

COV update, 174K more cases in 3 days.

Change in coloring scheme - now the colors show "new cases", calculated
as confirmed - (recovered+death). China had its color downgrade to
indianred their numbers have caught up, new confirmed cases do not
appear as fast.

Death rate: now that China's new cases slowed the fate of most of the
patients became clear, and if we believe their numbers, death rate is
near 4%.

It sure as shit is not 1%...

As comparison the Spanish Flu death rate was 2%, it killed 50 million
among population less in numbers at the time.

"@mikejanda

A wage subsidy is a good idea, but probably would’ve been a lot more effective if announced at the same time as the restrictions that effectively shut tens of thousands of businesses. So many workers already laid off and applying for welfare benefits.

'@m_stewart Yup. The model is the way New Zealand did it. I applied
for subsidy Tuesday, day after lockdown announcement, in bank account
by Thursday, first day of lockdown' "

Great. Each major country needs such capability within their borders. 

"German scientist Olfert Landt was already on alert. For 30 years, he
had worked on diagnosing emerging diseases, including Severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS). He wanted to make a test kit to help
doctors diagnose the disease -- and he wanted to do it fast.
Virologists usually wait until the genetic material of a new virus is
sequenced to start working on a test. This time, Landt and his
30-strong company TIB Molbiol got started early. By January 9 they had
designed their first test kit using SARS and other known coronaviruses
as references. Along with scientists from a local university hospital,
he designed three kits, meaning once the sequence was published, they
could pick the one that worked best..

In Hong Kong [... another scientist] Poon waited for the sequence.

All forms of life have a type of molecule that carries their genetic
instructions. In humans, and most life forms, that's DNA -- the
genetic material that tells us to grow two legs and walk upright...
But it wasn't until January 11, that the sequenced genome was posted
on open-source site virological.org on behalf of Zhang Yongzhen, a
professor from Shanghai's Fudan University. Chinese authorities shared
the sequence on January 12.

Once Zhang shared the sequence, Poon's team started work... Next, they
designed the test"

[Michael Hudson] "You talked about the current generation having to pay
off the depths of their predecessors. They’re not going to pay them
off, these debts cannot be paid off. They can go bankrupt, they can
starve, they can die sooner, but they cannot pay off the
debts. Mathematically, there’s no way of these exponential growth in
debts being paid off. In the end, every economy reaches a point where
the debts cannot be paid and it is a choice: either it can wipe out
the debts and grow again, or it can leave the debts in place and let
it strangle the economy"

"@zacharylipton

Why is ML 'taking over' so many adjacent fields, stealing the
spotlight & overshadowing (often-comparable) work? The rapid pace of
innovation? The talent? The tooling? I'm inclined to think the major
(unsung?) factor might just be the universality of \*\*\*open-access
publishing\*\*\*.

I've tried for hours today to access a desired chapter in a philosophy
volume that is relevant to my work. Eventually gave up. This pay-wall
nonsense is still pervasive in many fields but this would be
unthinkable in ML post-2000.

The combination of a universal culture of instantly-accessible
research (for both pre-prints and finished works) .. has perhaps
uniquely positioned ML steal spotlight from many other fields"

"An effective response to the virus needs to be orchestrated as a
coherent system of actions taken simultaneously. The results of the
approaches taken in China and South Korea underscore this point. While
the public discussion of the policies followed in these countries
often focuses on single elements of their models (such as extensive
testing), what truly characterizes their effective responses is the
multitude of actions that were taken at once"

Govs can provide an API, a machine digestible data providing simple
site for company financials (Edgar aint it). Some of the software
packages out there reverse engineer financial Web pages, they "scrape"
raw data out of visual data, which starts to fail when the visual of
the site is changed. A direct gov site would be much easier. Like u
enter treasury.gov/financials/year/ticker and out you get a JSON
output (text based, easy to process) for financials. Basically same
output as `yahoofinancials` but official. This data legally needs to
be public anyway. Post-CV feature request.
