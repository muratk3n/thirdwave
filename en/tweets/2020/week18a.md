"The death toll from coronavirus may be almost 60 per cent higher than
reported in official counts, according to an FT analysis of overall
fatalities during the pandemic in 14 countries.

Mortality statistics show 122,000 deaths in excess of normal levels
across these locations, considerably higher than the 77,000 official
Covid-19 deaths reported for the same places and time periods.

If the same level of under-reporting observed in these countries was
happening worldwide, the global Covid-19 death toll would rise from
the current official total of 201,000 to as high as 318,000"

I bet momentum trading strategies did well for so long bcz chasing the
FED paid off handsomely. That's what these things do, go after the
herd, and FED created the perfect trend to follow.

"@TheBubbleBubble

Believe it or not, the U.S. student loan bubble temporarily lowered
the unemployment rate: many people who couldn't find jobs after the
Great Recession simply took on a ton of student loans and went back to
school. VoilÃ  - they no longer counted as unemployed! It's magic!"

The NBER [paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21967.pdf)

*2020-4-26 21:8:5*

"An NBER paper issued last year concluded that changes to federal
student loans are more than sufficient to explain tuition increases at
private nonprofit colleges...

Unlike most other student loan programs, PLUS loans are not
cappedâ€”parents may borrow up to the cost of attendance, which is
determined by the college. This creates incentives for colleges to
increase student charges, since the federal government will make sure
all eligible parents have access to the money"

"@adam_tooze

If Germany borrows money on capital markets, including from wealthy
Italians, and then channels that money to Italy by way of the EU
budget what does it amount to? A eurobond but one controlled by
Germany! Great from @KeineWunder"

"[T]here is another viewpoint [different from electric grids] from
which these possible new electric-power-demand-boosting developments
do not look such good news. Itâ€™s based on a rival assessment of what
makes sense in terms of meeting energy needs â€” the use of gas as an
energy vector. This option is claimed to be more efficient and less
costly than electricity for heating, and possibly for other purposes.

It is certainly easier to transmit gas with lower energy losses. And
it can be stored, unlike electricity"

Yes some countries in fact do not allow free camping. This needs to
change.

"[Autotranslated] According to the World Bank, over 77 percent of
people in Germany live in cities. And these cities don't offer enough
space for everyone. If the Germans who love to travel stay in the
country this summer, .. there will be even less free terrain left
here, the double arm length will be a distant dream. Nature waits in
front of the city: forest and agriculture make up over 80 percent of
land use in Germany.

The townspeople just have to go outside. Not to the eternally the same
and soon overcrowded destinations such as Bastei Bridge, Drachenfels
or the TravemÃ¼nder Ostseestrand, but in the nameless and contagious
forest, in the Weserbergland, the Elfringhauser Switzerland or the
FlÃ¤ming.

It is therefore necessary to allow wild camping in the country. The
Scandinavian right of public could serve as a model: The allemansrÃ¤tt
, as it is called in Sweden, not only allows free access to nature -
this is also known as the "right of access" in Germany. It also allows
camping in the wild and only imposes restrictions, such as a minimum
distance from the sleeping area to houses"
