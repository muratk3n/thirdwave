I hate to say it, Mustache is right on this one. Especially for *I Am
CRM* types, the advice is __not__ to rely on instinct, conceptualize
things and act through them.

Bolton: "I came to understand that [DJT] believed he could run the
Executive Branch and establish national- security policies on
instinct, relying on personal relationships with foreign leaders, and
with made-for-television showmanship always top of mind.  Now,
instinct, personal relations, and showmanship are elements of any
President‚Äôs repertoire.  But they are not all of it, by a long
stretch.  Analysis, planning, intellectual discipline and rigor,
evaluation of results, course corrections, and the like are the
blocking and tackling of presidential decision-making, the unglamorous
side of the job.  Appearance takes you only so far"

Last night we watched FATAL ATTRACTION and I was shocked Michael
Douglas didn‚Äôt even get nominated for an Oscar. I couldn‚Äôt remember
who won that year so, all mad about it, I looked up what clown won
instead of Michael Douglas and it was Michael Douglas for Wall Street"

"[E]ngineers at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington
University ...  have developed high-power direct borohydride fuel
cells (DBFC) that operate at double the voltage of conventional
hydrogen fuel cells. Their research was published June 17 in the
journal Cell Reports *Physical Science*"

"The world‚Äôs entire energy system is going to be built around renewable
electricity and green hydrogen. This was an unconventional assertion
to make as little as six months ago. In some parts of the world it is
now perceived to be a statement of the obvious"

"Meanwhile,¬†the artificial leaf concept¬†has been swirling around in
the laboratory...

The basic idea is to skip the electricity middleperson and spark a
reaction in water directly, through solar energy. If you‚Äôre thinking
of¬†a photoelectrochemical reaction, run right out and buy yourself a
cigar"
