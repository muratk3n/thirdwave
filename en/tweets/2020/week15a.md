Now that the dollar sign is reserved for math symbols I need to watch
out the use of dollar sign, otherwise the rest is interpreted as math.

What kind of economy gets ruined with some months of lowered activity? This thing is designed badly. Even the stupidest techy would not design a system with so much dependence.

You don‚Äôt need an authoritarian state to fight coronavirus
effectively.

Germany, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan are doing very well.

You need a government that prioritizes science and expertise. And a

Keen: "[T]he danger that Garrett anticipated a quarter of a century
ago has come to pass. Had we designed our health and production
systems to cope with the inevitable event, we would have:

- Increased the capacity of our health systems, and trained doctors
  and nurses in excess of underlying demand;

- Produced stocks of standard emergency equipment like masks and
  ventilators (Garrett anticipated, correctly, that The Coming Plague
  would be a respiratory illness); Made our economies as robust as
  possible to a health crisis, with short supply chains, and an
  emphasis upon local rather than globalized production;

- Established free‚Äîindeed, be-paid-to-be-tested‚Äîhealth monitoring
  systems, to ensure that we can easily identify disease carriers
  during a pandemic; and

- Extended our monetary systems to finance normal expenditure by the
  bulk of the population in the event of a pandemic.

Of course, we have done the exact opposite. We have instead:

- Reduced the capacity of our health systems to cope with even
  standard episodic health issues, in the belief that not spending on
  social infrastructure was "saving for a rainy day";

- Designed an economic system in which production is focused in
  low-wage countries and exported to the rest of the world, via
  lengthy supply chains that involve as many as, for example, 43
  countries in producing an iPhone; and

- Allowed the private sector to run up the highest level of corporate
  and household debt in history, which has made the financial sector
  both incredibly powerful and incredibly fragile at the same time"

Yes NY data is not exactly straight line after "taking log". I could
explore "super-exponential" fit, as in $ e^{x^2}$ (holy shit!), but
for now, am looking at the data with two seperate exp regions. 

*2020-4-4 15:43:1*

Analyzig data as exponential fit.. We take "log" because of this,

$$
y = a e ^{b x}
$$

$$
\log(y) = \log(a eb x) 
$$

$$
= \log(a) + \log(eb x) = \log(a) + b x
$$

Now the slope of the curve is $b$, the param that defines the exp growth. 

Let's analyze some state data. How did NY do? So let's compare NY,
Washingon, and Ohio.


```python
import pandas as pd, os
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile(os.environ['HOME'] + '/Downloads/corona-county.zip', 'r') as z:
    df =  pd.read_csv(z.open('us-counties.csv'))
nycases = df[df['state'] == 'New York'].groupby('date')['cases'].sum()
ohcases = df[df['state'] == 'Ohio'].groupby('date')['cases'].sum()
wacases = df[df['state'] == 'Washington'].groupby('date')['cases'].sum()
nycases = nycases[nycases > 100].reset_index()
ohcases = ohcases[ohcases > 100].reset_index()
wacases = wacases[wacases > 100].reset_index()
df = pd.concat([nycases, ohcases, wacases],axis=1)
df = df.drop(['date'],axis=1)
df.columns = ['ny','oh','wa']
df = np.log(df)
df['oh'] = df.oh.fillna(0)
airny = 2.3 + 15.0 + 30.5; airoh = 4.0 + 4.2 + 4.8; airwa = 24.8
df.plot()
plt.savefig('states.png')
```

<img width="340" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EU5VNE_WoAAa-Ex?format=png&name=small"/>

X-axis is number of days after 100th case, so all three states start
from equal footing. The second week afterwards things went sideways
for Governor Fredo, growth took off seriously then. Ohio did well.

Now NY is doing as good as WA (same slope). Was the NY fail bcz of
significantly more air travel it gets, which was not stopped early? Or
Fredo effed up himself?

Added math symbol rendering support to my markdown pages. If you are using
Github Pages explained [here](https://github.com/cjerdonek/gh-pages-theme-slate),
add a`/_layouts/default.html` in root dir, copy contents of
[this](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate/blob/master/_layouts/default.html),
for MathJax add

```
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
  MathJax.Hub.Config({
    tex2jax: {inlineMath: [["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]]}
  });
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
   src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full">
</script>
```

in the meta. Now between `$$` or inline `$`  you can use math.

As easy as $\pi$.

"The greatest scientific legacy that Albert Einstein left us is this:
that the speed of light, and the laws of physics, appear to be the
same for all observers in the Universe. Regardless of where you're
located, how fast or in which direction you're moving, or when you're
performing your measurements, everyone experiences the same
fundamental rules of nature. The symmetry that underlies this, Lorentz
invariance, is the one symmetry that must never be violated.

However, many ideas that go beyond the Standard Model and General
Relativity ‚Äî such as string theory or most manifestations of quantum
gravity ‚Äî could break this symmetry, with consequences for what we'd
observe about the Universe. A new study by the HAWC collaboration,
just published on March 30, 2020, just placed the tightest constraints
on Lorentz invariance violation ever ..

The Standard Model is exactly Lorentz invariant. General Relativity is
exactly Lorentz invariant. But many incarnations of quantum gravity
are only approximately Lorentz invariant. Either the symmetry that
mandates it is broken, or there's new physics that only appears at
high-energy scales that breaks it. ...

One particularly good test that we can perform is to look at photons ‚Äî
quanta of light ‚Äî as they travel throughout the Universe. If Lorentz
invariance is a perfect, exact symmetry, then all photons of all
energies should propagate through the Universe ... If Lorentz
invariance holds, there should be a continuous spectrum of these
photons coming from these pulsars, without a hard cutoff ...

But what HAWC saw, to a precision that's almost 100 times better than
any previous measurement, indicates no violation at all...

[T]hese photon-based constraints teach us that if a quantum gravity
candidate such as string theory introduces a type of Lorentz
invariance violation that predicts an astrophysical signature of
photon decay, as many do, they are now constrained or even ruled out
by this new set of observations. The laws of physics really are the
same everywhere and at all times, and any extension to the Standard
Model and General Relativity must reckon with these new, robust
restrictions"
