# Infrastructure for Space

Excellent talk by Bezos. The vision is solid; even renewable energy
(the only kind that matters) will not suffice for population growth
forever, we have to increase our options. How? Large, habitable
O'Neill stations are one way that can have artificial gravity. To get
there, we need to build infrastructure; our generation's work.

Makes sense, with a million ppl per, a thousand of these things could
house a billion. They could be placed at any sufficiently close
distances to Earth, it'll work.

I direct attn attention to the mention of liquid hydrogen; truly the
fuel of the future. It is good for rockets, it is good for heating,
electricity, anything we can think of. Basically any place we humans
are interested in will have water anyway, with electrolysis we can
turn that water into fuel, using solar panels.

So we are not leaving Earth, simply stepping outside it for more
options, and even, for a little exercise. It's good to get used to
being in space, with bigger and bigger steps each time. Also these
stations will be Earth-like, not too far from Earth, best of both
worlds so to speak. Killer asteroid? Covered! Even with Earth gone a
few of these things would probably make it.
