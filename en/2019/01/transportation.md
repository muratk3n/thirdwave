# Transportation Infrastructure, NH3

To reiterate, cars can run longer range on same amt of fuel with H2
than gasoline.

Tank is filled in 5 minuts.

Hydrogen Fuel cell tech is already here.

H2 can be produced at gas stations. 

If not, the fuel can be transported to stations to get benefits of
scale. Transporting hydrogen was somewhat harder, but with the CSIRO
invention H2 can simply be taken out of NH3, on site. Where is the
ammonia come from? Ammonia is already produced in huge amounts in our
economy, transported easily as liquid at room temparature. We do need
to make sure tho the production of ammonia is green as well, but this is
already [doable](../../2018/10/fracked-up.md).

All this seems like slam-dunk. What is left is enterpreneurial, policy
push to implement it at scale. CSIRO probably has a patent on the
NH3/H2 seperation tech, a company needs to go into partnership with
them (patents suck, yes).

Countries with lots of sunshine, Australia, Saudi Arabia, can now
generate and export ammonia.

Countries like Russia can generate hydrogen and pipe it through the
same network used for natural gas. Britain has experiments underway to
use H2 as heating at homes.

So we dont frickin die in a few decades, air and water is clean, no
more wars to dig up some gunk from the soil.
