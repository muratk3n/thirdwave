# The Math for Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming

"This is an overview of Svante Arrhenius' 1896 article analyzing the
climatic relevance of atmospheric carbon dioxide for average global
ground temperatures. His research constitutes pioneering work in
modelling Earth's climate by incorporating the greenhouse effect and
accordingly points out fundamental mechanisms that contribute to
climate changes".

I like how the video covers how the science was developed and the
steps its inventors took, their thoughts to get there. More such
content please.

Note: Water vapor is effectively a greenhouse gas, and itself a
product of greenhouse effect. So you get the feedback effect, warmer
air can hold more vapor which in turn acts as a greenhouse gas,
helping air trap more heat.
