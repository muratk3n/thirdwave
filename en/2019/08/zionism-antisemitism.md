# Anti-Zionism, Anti-Semitism

"Is there a country in the world that attracts so much criticism as
Israel? Studies consistently show Israel to be one of the most
disliked nations in the world (along with Iran and North Korea). But
how much of this is to do with genuine concern about Israelâ€™s actions,
and how much is actually a cover for the age-old hatred of the Jews?"

The motion was crushed BTW; noone thinks anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.
