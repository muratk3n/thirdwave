# Hydrogen Cars


Alternative: see video on hydrogen fuel-cell cars... Hydrogen can be generated by seperating H2O, uh, water into its components by literally running an electric current through it (called electrolysis), over certain special conductors. Out comes hydrogen bubbles. If the electricity for the process comes from clean sources itself, we have a winner. There are ways to convert natural gas into hydrogen, and this also can be done cleanly. There is also work in progress to scale electrolysis based hydrogen production, same article also talks about storage safety.



Overall the tech is promising, fill up the tank with fuel, use / burn it , water comes out of the exhaust. 



There is a public / private partnership to further hydrogen fuel-cell research. 



The tech is already commercialized. Honda has an HFC based car.

Now suddenly the Tesla Gigafactory investment seems dubious, it is a huge commitment in one specific technology (lithium-ion, unless it has the flexibility to produce different types of batteries as well, but my guess would be no, pivoting would be slow).
