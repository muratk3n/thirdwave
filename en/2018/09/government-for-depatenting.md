# Government for De-Patenting

Appelbaum

In April 1952, dozens of engineers from some of the world’s largest
companies .. boarded buses in New York City and headed [to AT&T]. They
were guests of AT&T, which had patented a new electronic device called
a transistor just a few months earlier, and had invited its potential
rivals to spend nine days learning exactly how they could make
transistors, too. ...

There was a simple explanation for AT&T’s generosity: the federal
government forced the company to share its inventions as part of an
aggressive, carefully considered, and wide-ranging campaign to prevent
large and powerful companies from hoarding innovations...

The mythology of the computer revolution, of libertarians developing
ideas in Silicon Valley garages, is usually narrated without any
mention of the role played by government. It was antitrust regulation
that opened the market and allowed those ideas to bloom.

Limiting the market power of large corporations was a distinctly
American tradition
