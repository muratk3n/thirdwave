Some scientific news:

* Fossil over 4 million years old suggests we did not evolve from
  chimpanzee. The common ancestor is more human-like.

* "New findings suggest that either String Theory is wrong or we are
  wrong about our universe". Yeeah... I am going to go out on a limb
  here and say that it is the former not the latter, but hey, go at it
  for another 40 years.

* Quantum mechanics needs no conciousness: in the double-slit
  experiment, the path is "decided" when a concious observer observes
  it. It turns out even recording the info on a single atom is enough
  to "decide" the path taken.
