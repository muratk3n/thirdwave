It is hilarious how corporate Democrats trying to explain away this win. First it was her ethnicity, then gender, now region. It can be anything else except the platform. Which some jackass even tried to distort. This event has been a constant source of comedy for me. 


Congrats to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her campaign was well executed.
