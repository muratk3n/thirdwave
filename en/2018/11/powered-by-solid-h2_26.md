The Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) announced on
Sunday the launch of the country's first electric vehicle powered by
solid hydrogen fuel emitted from Nanopowders.

This came in a press release, after a visit of KISR Director General,
Samira Al-Sayed Omar to the program of nanotechnology and advanced
materials at the Institute, where she looked at the prototype of the
electric vehicle powered by hydrogen fuel.

The program was led by Osama Al-Sayegh, Executive Director of the
Institute's Energy and Construction Research Center, as saying that
the Center's Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Program has
successfully launched the experimental prototype of an electric
vehicle powered by solid hydrogen fuel emitted from Nanopowders.

"These powders were prepared by the Center's compound for chemically
induced magnesium hydride adsorption by ultra-smooth granules of the
glass alloy (ZrNiPd)," Al-Sayegh added.

Phonemonal. Good to see Gulf countries researching new energy, it
looks like they landed on all fours again, blessed first with fossil
resources, and lots of sunshine. As Australia is planning to do, they
could easily become major exporters of energy, green this time, yet
again.

Whenever I hear the word "solid" or "liquid" related to H, I pay
attention, because it will mean even easier transportation. There is a
company in Japan called Chiyoda who has Spera Hyd
[technology](https://www.chiyodacorp.com/en/service/spera-hydrogen/innovations/),
that allows them to store fuel in liquid form, at regular temparature
and pressure. Then H can be transported just like oil.
