The government policy that is inflating the money supply is the Chinese currency peg. China is a magnet for foreign capital, bringing in far more in exports and investment than it pays out. Normally, this would result in the value of foreign currencies depreciating relative to the local currency. But in order to maintain its fixed exchange rate, China's central banks buys all those extra dollars and euros, replacing them with renminbi. This means that the government is constantly expanding the money supply. And as long as that keeps happening, China will keep on experiencing elevated inflation.

Right

Current scheme (huge foreign reserves) is inflationary for China. No matter at what level one keeps the local currency, you are never in control of your money supply because intense influx of foreign capital (exports, investments) has to be converted to local currency, at some level, and that can be inflationary.

Sean Carroll

[A physicist, paraphrasing] The state of the "quantum disagreement" in the phyics community is an embarrassment. 

The understatement of the year

They asked physicist their favorite interpretation of QM and the video shows the results. Even the CQM people are at 42%. Forty two. This is the mainstream! Caroll himself follows the Many-Worlds interpretation (at 18%). So for them Schrodinger's cat would not be dead and alive, but the dead cat and the alive cat would be....wait for it.. in different universes. Pffffff..fffff yeah man.. it blows my mind....

Let's clarify it with an example..

So the evil Shatner in one universe would have the dead cat. The good Shatner would have the alive cat.

Or the other way around..

After spending a little time learning about it many years ago, I quickly decided that I personally didn’t like pilot-wave theory [the deterministic version of QM], partly because it seems to me that it throws out all the deep, amazing and experimentally verified links between modern physics and mathematics that motivate what I love about the subjects

You wanna do sexy math basically

.. instead of focusing on what's really going on. This is coming from the guy blaming SUSY followers with similar needless adventurism  (which I agree with) when it comes to unified theories. I guess he was projecting a little.

Mr. Trump’s critics should continue fighting fiercely against his attempts — on Twitter and off — to undermine the rule of law, to rig the system in favor of himself and his cronies and to take down not only the Constitution but also quite possibly, if he gets the chance, the Ptolemaic model, Newton’s Law [..]

Ptolemaic model was already wrong  

.. and Copernicus took care of that.

Snowden

You can despise Wikileaks and everything it stands for. You can think Assange is an evil spirit reanimated by Putin himself. But you cannot support the prosecution of a publisher for publishing without narrowing the basic rights every newspaper relies on.

Yes
