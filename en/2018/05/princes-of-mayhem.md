Executive summary: if, per Werner, countries should not direct credit
to speculation, then, if one wanted to, one could create bubbles
(which must later burst) in order to spur artificial recessions. The
video claims that is exactly what happened in Japan to force
structural change, and in EU (Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal) to
force a European unification (ECB is at fault). The Krauts would not
be fine with that plan, so the deed probably originated from a
"splinter cell" based in France which is known to house a sizeable
elite who really wants to see a greater EU unification.

This explains Japan and its perennial recession: they could get out of recession at any point if they wanted to, but their financial elite chose not to. J easily could have carried toxic assets from banks to the central bank (an accounting slight of hand, does not create money, simply increases a bank's reserve at the CB), helping banks to lend again. He credits Bernanke to take this step quickly in US. ECB could do the same but they too, like Japan, want recession in the periphery.

More gems here, and here. Historically, the data does not suggest lower / higher interest rates cause higher / lower economic activity, central banks are mostly followers of growth rather than the other way around.
