# Q&A - 30/5

Question

How do we grow an economy?

GDP, Credit

Better education, healthier citizens, or the kind of stuff that
Hidalgo recommends raise GDP potential. Then you provide the necessary
credit so that GDP potential can be actualized. Any less you get
deflation, any more you get inflation. Aiming for 2% and seeing it
happen is actually great, bcz then policymakers know the credit is
just right, inflation is also spurring people to spend.

Question

How was the mood in New York right after 9/11?

Okay

I was in NYC during the whole thing BTW - very uneventful for
me. Afterwards, also fine. A year later I went to Comedy Cellar, guy
was trying out new material - he had one joke on Bin Laden. He had Bin
Laden and Bill Clinton smoking hookah - Clinton takes a drag, then
says "Bin Laden? What kind of name is that? How about Been Lovin? How
about Been Fuckin?". It was a big joke. He did the whole accent and
everything, well by this time even I could do it... So the mood was
fine.
