Comment

United States never defaulted on its debt obligations

Wrong

From New Paradigm in Macroeconomics: "Excess credit creation in the US would also be reflected in increased foreign investment. [I]n the 1960s the US dollar was effectively the world’s currency, and thus additional creation of dollars could be expected to be diffused around the world, without any adjustment in exchange rates – until the world rebels [US was basically printing excessive dollars and "buying up Europe", the French caught on]. When France decided to convert US dollars into gold at the official fixed price, as the Bretton Woods system formally provided for [calling US's bluff], the US had to make the decision whether to make good on its promise to redeem the excessively created dollars into gold, or whether it should break its promise – and with it bring down the Bretton Woods System of fixed exchange rates. France proceeded to demand conversion of dollars into gold, in an episode later called the ‘French raid on Fort Knox’. The US leadership decided to break its promise. It ‘closed the gold window’".

That is a default on debt. Money in this old system is an IOU for gold, French wanted their gold for their IOU but did not get it.

You could argue of course then US switched to petrodollar system and those dollars become even more valueable but still.. A default is a default.

Question

Laurel or Yanni

He or She

[On the voice recording who some people hear as Laurel some as
Yanni]. Apparently gender is a major factor on what people hear. Dude
[here](https://youtu.be/M7QY4Gbz9uA?t=22) did the science (as much as
he could based on Twitter surveys),  women are 55%/45% Yanni,
men 60%/40% Laurel. Using actual counts, and Fisher's exact test


``` fm = np.array([[65.0,80.0],[142.0,96.0]]) uo35 =
np.array([[60.0,56.0],[21.0,22.0]]) import scipy.stats as stats print
(stats.fisher_exact(fm)) print (stats.fisher_exact(uo35))

(0.54929577464788737, 0.0059272092668501948)
(1.1224489795918366, 0.85850083655070586)
```

So the differences are significant for gender, but not for age.

Question

I hear about Web 3.0 all the time

Yes

That thing can hit like a freight train, all of a sudden and without warning. Watch out.
