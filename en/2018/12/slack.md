Slack [shuts
down](https://mobile.twitter.com/nick_brana/status/1076130399116505088)
a movement for Rep/Dem alternative - [MPP](https://www.forapeoplesparty.org).

Washington Consensus is in overdrive. Shutdowns are all over the

messaging platforms, and of course, decentralized payments. Bitcoin!

Satellite](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-from-space-blockstream-cso-explains-its-satellite-services)?
