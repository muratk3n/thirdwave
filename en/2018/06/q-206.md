Who came up with the Canadian single-payer healthcare? It was surely the current prime minister's father Trudeau?

No

It was Tommy Douglas - who oddly enough ran against the father Trudeau and lost because he did not provide enough "good TV". It was the 60s. I remembered that tidbit when the son Trudeau disappointed environmentalists lately by supporting fossil fuel production. Maybe we should bar ppl who are "too presentable" from running for office?

Question

I don't want to work with Excel files, can you give me markdown and csv files for Greece current account?

Sure

Code, Data

The opioid crisis began in the 1990s, when doctors became increasingly aware of the burdens of chronic pain. Pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity, and pushed doctors — with misleading marketing about the safety and efficacy of the drugs — to prescribe opioids to treat all sorts of pain.

Doctors, many exhausted by dealing with difficult-to-treat pain patients, complied — in some states, writing enough prescriptions to fill a bottle of pills for each resident. The drugs proliferated, landing in the hands of not just patients but also teens rummaging through their parents’ medicine cabinets, other family members, friends of patients, and the black market.

Wait

So are they saying big pharma is complicit in creating this crisis? They killed more ppl annually than the Vietnam War? Dude!
