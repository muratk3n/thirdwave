# Learning to Drive
The root of the problem has to do with the idea of a function. Functions are computation - we use them all the time, to decide, to compute anything and everything. 2+2 = 4. I see something, it has wings, it flies, it's a bird.

But as scientists, modelers, we don't see all of these functions as nature keeps them hidden, so we cannot encode them easily on a machine. But DL gave us a way to approximate these functions, reverse-engineer them from data. The problem is, with the driving example mentioned, there might not be a direct function between controls and outside images. If the root of science is math, and the root of math is number theory / sets, a function is a mapping from one set to another, a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping. If image X results in left steering, similar image Y in right steering, there is no function there. 2 + 2 cannot give you 4 and 14 at the same time (3=1 being 4 is okay though). DL cannot approximate such data coming from such process, that is not a function.

I like the solution employed by the researchers - they learn distances to other cars from images, something less prone to confusing signals.

And here is your moment of Zen...
