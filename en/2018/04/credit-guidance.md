# Credit Guidance

MV = YP where M is the money supply, but since private banks create
money, M is credit. If credit does not go to growth (the Y) it will go
to inflation (the P). Inflation can occur in many ways, asset price
inflation is one of them, such as house price bubbles, stock market
bubbles so forth. I like Werner's idea - either regulate banks so they
give credit for "good" purposes, for innovation, new products (then
there is growth), or restructure the system so that good lending
occurs naturally. Financial speculation should never have access to
bank credit. So [don't do](https://youtu.be/EC0G7pY4wRE?t=609) what UK
does.
