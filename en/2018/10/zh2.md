As it is, dependence on fossil fuels can be a strategic mistake. Recent news: "Taliban set fire to 200 fuel trucks in Afghanistan. The tankers were set on fire as they sat in a parking lot waiting to enter Kabul which the insurgents claim were supplying foreign troops".Â  Per the GM link, the army could have a big electrolyzer at the main operating base producing its own fuel using nearby water and the sun, and supply hydrogen fuel to ZH2s (pure battery reloading is too slow, plus with H2 you can store excess energy easily), then there would be no dependence on costly fossil fuel transportation infrastructure.
