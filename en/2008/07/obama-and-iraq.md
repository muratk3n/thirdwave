# Obama and Iraq

Whatzup my biz-nitches? Wizzle to tizzle bizzle (welcome to this blog). Shizzle my nizzle.

OK. After this great literary entrance, let me get right to the point: Obama must be very careful with that balancing act between what he said before and he is planning to say next when it comes to Iraq. On one hand, there is the issue that MADE him, on the other hand, is the need for more votes. But, the issue that made him got him those ardent followers, the groupies; For that one issue, they labeled him courageous, put him outside the mainstream, cheered for him, campagined and worked for him. If Obama drops that Iraq issue, or even tries to turn the heat down little bit, he will pay the price. Because by now being against Iraq War, and getting out of there ASAP has become part of this brand. He cannot drop it anymore.

That was the politics side. Now let's discuss the hard cold reality.

On the foreign language version of this site, I've posted long winded discussion on oil production, even equations on when to predict the peak oil date for world production. I even wrote this neat little MATLAB code that spits out ... theeee answeeer for peak oil!!! And it waaass 2001! Yeah. Like the movie. So maybe we should have partied like it was 2000 eh? I must add though that the results is 2001 give and take 10 years. Hence the fall can start on 2011.

What does this have anything to do with Obama's Iraq woes? Woes? Is that too strong? Slip-up maybe. Hmmm.,. Testing the waters, say. Market testing. Probing? If you will? OK. Probing.

For sure the "probing" had to account the foreign policy issues. Yes world is running out of oil, and yes it is good for America for American oil companies to be in Iraq than not. However, hasn't anyone in Obama's foreign policy team looked at the latest situation in the ground? The new scheme cooked up by oil companies and Iraqi government essentially opened Iraq for business. Yes, Chinese, Russians got the bad end of the deal. Before the war, they were signing fat contracts with Saddam for nice oil exploration/production deals, now they are OUT. Such is the world of dog eats dog realpolitik and resource squabbles. You got the guns? You get the prize.

Anyway; What I am trying to say is, since US oil companies reached their goal, US troops can really leave Iraq and let production go on its merry way. Mission accomplished (for real this time). Of course they would leave with a warning: You try to boot us out, there will be rain of fire on you from 300 miles away! Tomehawks dude! Not the wooden kind either. So now everyone's happy.

Oh darn... Did I just find that middle ground where voters are happy with the appearance while politician saves his ass, and still look consistent? Damn. I guess I have.

Unfortunately, when it comes to resource politics, this is the best you can expect from any president, until that black gold runs out.

Obama at least won't bow down to oil companies like W has, will probably increase research funding for alternative energy sources, and lots of other goodies. Middle East can expect a president that will kill them a little less this time, now that the guy looks little more like them than Count Dracula. This, ladies and gentleman, is called an improvement in mass politics, second-wave industrial political machine, winner takes all, we'll-ask-your-opinion-once-upon-a-blue-moon system.
