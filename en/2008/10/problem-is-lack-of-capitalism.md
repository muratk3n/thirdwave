# Problem is Lack of Capitalism
One more time I hear the word "capitalism in crisis" I am going to clean someone's clock. I seriously had it with people who think the system they live in was capitalism, and now that we are in crisis, these people automatically think it was capitalism that was in crisis.This cannot be further from the truth. Even though it took them a while to wake up and smell the coffee, Economist and Newsweek finally published a series of articles that admit the current crisis has government's fingerprints all over it. Mortgages were "subsidized" (read: not capitalism) which caused risk perceptions around these instruments to be pushed largely outside the free market economy. Oh; But the sexy instruments that were around these non-risky mortgages have been inside the system, and boy, did people like them. Such instruments spread in the system like wildfire because everyone likes a free lunch. Nobody likes excessive risk. Enter the mortgage based derivatives.The party, of course, could not last forever. Finallly the real world caught up (rising oil prices, changing economic conditions, ridicolous real estate baloon size) that finally caused real estate prices to go down, and down went derivatives and the phony economy associated with them.What does this mean for Third Wave? Interestingly, a lot. A quick analysis will show that what died was second wave suburbia livin', nuclear family based economic structure which came about to support a factory centered lifestyle. This lifestyle has been supported and subsidized by automotive/oil/construction interests who are in bed with second wave economy (and W is their man -any doubts on this?-). However, this lifestyle has no basis in post-modern American living anymore - just another reason why the subsidies fell flat on their face and had to poison the rest of the economy before they collapsed ultimately and utterly.What will follow, one hopes, is "more market centered" economy which will finally funnel investment where is needed, and useful. Surely US finance has fueled innovation well up to this point which was he reason dot com era happened there, biotech, and other research continues to enjoy solid investment. Maybe one can categorize what has happened recently as the collapse of the last bastion of backwardness in the system - once it is gone, Third Wave will be able to come much stronger in force.Crisis is helping Obama campaign which is another good news for us. We all know he is our guy. Once he is in office, he will be all about clean energy (read: not oil), innovation, technology, and all the other goodies. The rest of the fucktards can go to hell (or to Iraq which they turned into one). A much better era awaits us.Don't listen to Europeans' blabbering either: There is nothing wrong with speculation. In any market based economy, regulate it as much as you want, there will be speculation. Hell, I wrote, am writing computer software that do just that. You can't stop that sh*t. Europeans have much bigger problems, the rhetoric is partly to cover this and partly, market oriented leaders want to quell crazy-leftist leanings in their countries. Sarko has been very adapt at this game, he is effectively talking with both sides of his mouth, throwing bones to crazy-lefties in rhetoric and in some symbolic gestures, while moving on with market reforms nevertheless. What else can he do? There is NO OTHER WAY.What? Someone said capitalism in crisis? [reaches down to open a can of ...]
