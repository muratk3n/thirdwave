# Policy Advice
[Question was asked to Brin -of Google-]: But why isn't the company devoting more of its innovation firepower to the wildly inefficient U.S. health care industry, which hogs about 18% of GDP? Brin explained:

"Generally, health is just so heavily regulated. It's just a painful business to be in. It's just not necessarily how I want to spend my time. Even though we do have some health projects, and we'll be doing that to a certain extent. But I think the regulatory burden in the U.S. is so high that think it would dissuade a lot of entrepreneurs".

Page echoed Brin, and then speculated that if researchers were allowed to anonymously mine medical records "I imagine that would save 10,000 lives in the first year." That can't happen, noted Page, because of rules imposed by the 1996 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Later in the interview, an audience member asked the co-founders if government makes it more difficult for them to engage in long-term planning. Page responded by offering some perspective on how regulation that "increases without bounds" is likely to lead government "to collapse under its own weight:"

1. Find out what law, regulation is troubling Google

2. Make it go away
