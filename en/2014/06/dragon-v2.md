# Dragon V2

Elon Musk demonstrating Dragon Version 2. The new spacecraft will be able land, with the accuracy of a helicopter he says. No more dropping like a stone in the middle of an ocean. The engine of the aircraft is 3D printed! The casing of the engine, or everything inside it I wonder... In any case, it is apparent metal 3D printing has come a long way. Very cool.
