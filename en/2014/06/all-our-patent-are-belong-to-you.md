# All Our Patent Are Belong To You

Elon Musk

Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo
Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed,
in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of
electric vehicle technology [..]

When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were
a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good
long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle
progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich
those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After
Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that
you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever
possible.

At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern
that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use
their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm
Tesla. We couldn’t have been more wrong [..]

Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers. We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.

Very cool
