# Q&A - 7/10

If 3W is about more decentralization, isnt more countries breaking up a good thing?

Not necessarily

I was against the Scotland break-up. This might surprise some of our readers, but generally we do not advocate wild-eyedÂ  break-up of all countries all over the world. We'd prefer  current crop of countries to remain united, as long as possible, even / especially in troubled regions. That means  united Syria, united Iraq, united Ukraine, united Turkey, United Kingdom, united EU, more countries in EU, UK in EU... All that. Why? This brings us to our earlier argument about long-term, near-term distinction. In the  future when 3W based civilization (not if) takes hold, noone knows how many countries will there be, in what capacity, in what regions of influence. That is a very big unknown. Until that time however, IMO, it is imperative for The Integrators of the current countries to learn to play nice with their diverse populace internally, and aim to interact with external others peacefully. We made this argument for Iraq - break up.. why?  So you can go to war as neighbors instead of citizens?

For other cases, if there is no trouble and a country still breaks up, wouldnt they, the next day, start thinking about how to integrate better? Like, "let's have common money, less tariffs, less bureucracy during trade". But, that's what you just had previously. Why would you take two steps back to go one step forward? 

Again, post-industrial civilization will be in whatever shape or form, noone knows exactly how. The country make-up is not the key question here; So thinkers should avoid using country break-ups as an intellectual crutch, that somehow countries falling apart is a sign, or necessary precondition of all that is good.

Break-up-ism, much like globalization, is not where the action is at.

Question

But isnt globalization the ultimate opposite of countries staying united?

No

90s globalization was a rebranded Pax-Americana which we all know has been discredited. The other version, that says "buy screws from Japan, wheels from Shangai, lightbulbs from Bulgaria and assemble the car in Moldova and sell in Uganda" is not only unrealistic, with rising of transportation costs (due to peak oil), is most likely unsustainable. Production IMHO will get more local, less global. You want to interact with the guy near you more, because you can see near better. Far, it's harder because earth is round (Duh). 

Question

But there are so many Starbucks stores in so many countries!

That's different

Franchising is not globalization -- franchising is about a company replicating itself in a different locality. It is not globalization the way "90s thinkers" mean it. 

Question

Okay, 1 percenters dont spend, but wouldnt they invest with their money and create jobs? 

Yes they might

.. but unfortunately,  trickle-down economics gets all out of balance in a knowledge economy as well; Let's say a billionaire wanted to invest in a company; which one would she or he invest in? A, B, or C.. so many choices. Say he chose WhatsApp - a 19 billion dollar company with  exactly 55 employees. I dont think such an investment would dent unemployment numbers much. Surely there are companies employing hundreds, or a thousand employees. Is thousand  a big number? Maybe. But comparatively, in 1913 Henry Ford employed up to 1000 people simply to move material in his company [1]. Compared to 2W, the numbers of today seem measly (oh, and we have more people, let's not forget).
