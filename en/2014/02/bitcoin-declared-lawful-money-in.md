# Bitcoin Declared Lawful Money in California

The California State Assembly has unanimously passed measure AB 129
declaring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as “lawful money.”
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Ripple, and Peercoin
have gained popularity over the past year [..].It only makes sense
that the California State Assembly would declare Bitcoin as lawful
money. Many of California technology giants in Silicon Valley have
been developing infrastructure that would support the use of Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies. The use of Bitcoin could potentially help
to facilitate transactions across California and the rest of the world
– California itself has the twelfth largest economy in the world. In
2013, California’s Gross State Product was $2.08 trillion – matching
that of Russia, Italy and India.
