# Is Earth F**ked?

In December 2012, a pink-haired complex systems researcher named Brad
Werner made his way through the throng of 24,000 earth and space
scientists at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union, held
annually in San Francisco [.. I]t was Werner’s own session that was
attracting much of the buzz. It was titled “Is Earth F**ked?” (full
title: “Is Earth F**ked? Dynamical Futility of Global Environmental
Management and Possibilities for Sustainability via Direct Action
Activism”).

Standing at the front of the conference room, the geophysicist from
the University of California, San Diego walked the crowd through the
advanced computer model he was using to answer that question. He
talked about system boundaries, perturbations, dissipation,
attractors, bifurcations and a whole bunch of other stuff largely
incomprehensible to those of us uninitiated in complex systems theory
[..] When pressed by a journalist for a clear answer on the “are we
f**ked” question, Werner set the jargon aside and replied, “More or
less.”
