# Why Bitcoin Matters

Bitcoin is the first practical solution to a longstanding problem in
computer science called the Byzantine Generals Problem [..] which
poses the question of how to establish trust between otherwise
unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet.

The practical consequence of solving this 
problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one 
Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another 
Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and 
secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can
 challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this 
breakthrough are hard to overstate.

What kinds of digital property might be transferred in this way? Think 
about digital signatures, digital contracts, digital keys (to physical 
locks, or to online lockers), digital ownership of physical assets such 
as cars and houses, digital stocks and bonds … and digital money.

All these are exchanged through a distributed
 network of trust that does not require or rely upon a central 
intermediary like a bank or broker. And all in a way where only the 
owner of an asset can send it, only the intended recipient can receive 
it, the asset can only exist in one place at a time, and everyone can 
validate transactions and ownership of all assets anytime they want.

How does this work?

Bitcoin is an Internet-wide distributed 
ledger [..] Anyone in the world can buy into or sell 
out of the ledger any time they want – with no approval needed, and with
 no or very low fees. The Bitcoin “coins” themselves are simply slots in
 the ledger, analogous in some ways to seats on a stock exchange, except
 much more broadly applicable to real world transactions.

The Bitcoin ledger is a new kind of payment system. Anyone in the world 
can pay anyone else in the world any amount of value of Bitcoin by 
simply transferring ownership of the corresponding slot in the ledger. 
Put value in, transfer it, the recipient gets value out, no 
authorization required, and in many cases, no fees.

That last part is enormously important. Bitcoin is the first 
Internetwide payment system where transactions either happen with no 
fees or very low fees (down to fractions of pennies). Existing payment 
systems charge fees of about 2 to 3 percent – and that’s in the 
developed world. In lots of other places, there either are no modern 
payment systems or the rates are significantly higher [..]. 

Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument. It is
 a way to exchange money or assets between parties with no pre-existing 
trust: A string of numbers is sent over email or text message in the 
simplest case. The sender doesn’t need to know or trust the receiver or 
vice versa. Related, there are no chargebacks – this is the part that is
 literally like cash – if you have the money or the asset, you can pay 
with it; if you don’t, you can’t. This is brand new. This has never 
existed in digital form before [..].
 

Critics of Bitcoin point to limited usage by 
ordinary consumers and merchants, but that same criticism was leveled 
against PCs and the Internet at the same stage. Every day, more and more
 consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling Bitcoin, all 
around the world. The overall numbers are still small, but they are 
growing quickly. And ease of use for all participants is rapidly 
increasing as Bitcoin tools and technologies are improved. Remember, it 
used to be technically challenging to even get on the Internet. Now it’s
 not [..].

In addition, merchants are highly attracted to Bitcoin because it eliminates the risk of credit card fraud [..]. 
Credit card fraud is such a big deal for 
merchants, credit card processors and banks that online fraud detection 
systems are hair-trigger wired to stop transactions that look even 
slightly suspicious, whether or not they are actually fraudulent. As a 
result, many online merchants are forced to turn away 5 to 10 percent of
 incoming orders that they could take without fear if the customers were
 paying with Bitcoin [..].

And even here in the United States, a long-recognized problem is the 
extremely high fees that the “unbanked” — people without conventional 
bank accounts – pay for even basic financial services. Bitcoin can be 
used to go straight at that problem, by making it easy to offer 
extremely low-fee services to people outside of the traditional 
financial system [..].

Bitcoins have the nifty property of infinite divisibility: currently 
down to eight decimal places after the dot, but more in the future. So 
you can specify an arbitrarily small amount of money [..] Think about content monetization, for example. One reason media 
businesses such as newspapers struggle to charge for content is because 
they need to charge either all (pay the entire subscription fee for all 
the content) or nothing (which then results in all those terrible banner
 ads everywhere on the web). All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, there is an 
economically viable way to charge arbitrarily small amounts of money per
 article, or per section, or per hour, or per video play, or per archive
 access, or per news alert [..].

Another potential use of Bitcoin micropayments is to fight spam. Future 
email systems and social networks could refuse to accept incoming 
messages unless they were accompanied with tiny amounts of Bitcoin – 
tiny enough to not matter to the sender, but large enough to deter 
spammers, who today can send uncounted billions of spam messages for 
free with impunity [this is very interesting]. 

[Another] interesting use case is 
public payments. This idea first came to my attention in a news article a
 few months ago. A random spectator at a televised sports event held up a
 placard with a QR code and the text “Send me Bitcoin!” He received 
$25,000 in Bitcoin in the first 24 hours, all from people he had never 
met [..].  Think about the implications for protest movements. 

The coming years will be a period of great drama and excitement revolving around this new technology.

For example, some prominent economists are 
deeply skeptical of Bitcoin, even though Ben S. Bernanke, formerly 
Federal Reserve chairman, recently wrote that digital currencies like 
Bitcoin “may hold long-term promise, particularly if they promote a 
faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” And in 1999, the
 legendary economist Milton Friedman said: “One thing that’s missing but
 will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the 
Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B 
knowing A – the way I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you, and 
you may get that without knowing who I am.” 

Economists who attack Bitcoin today might be correct, but I’m with Ben and Milton.

So am I
