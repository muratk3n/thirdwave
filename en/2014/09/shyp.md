# Shyp

Link 

The premise of Shyp is simple by design. The idea is to provide the 
next best thing to pure teleportation. Download the app, take a picture 
of the thing you want to ship, put in the address where you want it to 
go—and you’re done. No bubble-wrap. No packing tape. No weighing or 
deciding between UPS and FedEx. A Shyp courier just comes to your door 
within about 20 minutes and takes the stuff off your hands. That’s it.
