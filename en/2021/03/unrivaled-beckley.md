Russia - China

Russia and China currently maintain a “strategic partnership,” but
this relationship is unlikely to become a genuine alliance, because
the two coun- tries share a 2,600-mile border and a desire to dominate
Eurasia—a goal that one side can accomplish only by subjugating the
other. Perhaps a shared hatred of the United States will bring Russia
and China together, but history suggests otherwise. At the start of
the Cold War, China initially aligned with the Soviet Union, but by
the 1960s the two Communist powers were literally at war with each
other, and in the 1970s China offi - cially switched sides and aligned
with the United States.

Today, many Russian and Chinese strategists warn their respective gov-
ernments not to place too much faith in a sustainable partnership.
Foreign analysts come to similar conclusions. As one study explains:
“[Sino- Russian] cooperationp is limited to areas where their interests
already overlap, like bolstering trade. In the parts of the world that
matter most to them, Russia and China are more rivals than allies.”

For every example of Sino-Russian cooperation, there is a
counterexample of competition. For instance, Russia sells weapons to
China, but it recently reduced sales to China while increasing sales
to China’s rivals, most notably India and Vietnam. Russia and China
conduct joint military exercises, but they also train with each
other’s enemies and conduct unilateral exercises simulating a
Sino-Russian war. The two countries share an interest in devel- oping
Central Asia, but Russia wants to tether the region to Moscow via the
Eurasian Economic Union whereas China wants to reconstitute the Silk
Road and link China to the Middle East and Europe while bypassing
Russia. Collectively, these confl icting interests have placed Russia
and China “on a trajectory toward intensifying competition from latent
to emergent rivalry.”
