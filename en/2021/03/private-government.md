# Private Government

American public discourse is also mostly silent about the regulations
employers impose on their workers. We have the language of fairness
and distributive justice to talk about low wages and inadequate
benefits. We know how to talk about the Fight for $15, whatever side
of this issue we are on. But we don’t have good ways to talk about the
way bosses rule workers’ lives.  Instead, we talk as if workers aren’t
ruled by their bosses.  We are told that unregulated markets make us
free, and that the only threat to our liberties is the state. We are
told that in the market, all transactions are voluntary. We are told
that, since workers freely enter and exit the labor contract, they are
per- fectly free under it: bosses have no more authority over workers
than customers have over their grocer.

Labor movement activists have long argued that this is wrong. In
ordinary markets, a vendor can sell their product to a buyer, and once
the transaction is complete, each walks away as free from the other as
before. Labor markets are differ- ent. When workers sell their labor
to an employer, they have to hand themselves over to their boss, who
then gets to order them around. The labor contract, instead of leaving
the seller as free as before, puts the seller under the authority of
their boss. Since the decline of the labor movement, however, we don’t
have effective ways to talk about this fact, and hence about what
kinds of authority bosses should and shouldn’t have over their
workers.
