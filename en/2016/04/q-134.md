# Q&A - 13/4

There have been extinction level events triggered by asteroid hits on
the Earth, but it is also known Jupiter with its massive size
protected Earth before, pulling asteroids to itself. Are these views
contradictory?

No

With the Planet 9 explanation, it all makes sense. Jupiter is massive
(in fact some jokingly refer to our solar system as "Jupiter and some
debris"), it saved us before, but P9, being a planet itself, can enter
deep into the solar system, knocking stuff in the direction of
Earth. Jupiter would not be able to run interference against those.

Some more info on the subject: about the periodicity and measurement
of extinction events, paper. My notebook that looks at frequencies of
extinction events [geek] using the Lomb-Scargle method that computes
statistical significance of peaks, rather than direct Fourier Analysis
[/geek]. I reverse-engineered the graph here  with image processing to
get its raw data (who da man!) and compute the periods of extinction
events. The result is this, and periods in this. There is one period
of 25 million years, and one for around 70 - dinosaurs were wiped out
66 million years ago during one of these I assume.
