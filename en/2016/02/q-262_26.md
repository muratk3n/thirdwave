Why are there so many anti-establishment candidates [..]

Anti what? 

This word is sometimes used to describe Bernie Sanders for example - but they forget the man has been in Congress for decades, and was a mayor before that. So Bernie is also "the establishment", but he is from a different  part of the establishment that won some of the recent elections. That's all.

Broadly speaking, I don't think the public will benefit from simply electing an outsider to work inside the existing system - like The Trump. Either 
the system changes wholesale, becomes something else obviating this incessant need for saviors, heroes who over-promise and under-deliver, or, incremental 
improvements are made in the right direction by experienced operators  who 
know the system inside-out. Hillary could probably do that, Bernie  as well (my #2 choice). On the Republican side it could be Rubio; he seems to be the least insane among the others.
