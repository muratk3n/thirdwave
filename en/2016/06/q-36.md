# Q&A - 3/6

<a name="howitis"/>

People long for a politician who says it like it is.

It's a trend

It all started with Jesse Ventura; former Navy Seal, pro-wrestler, he
was like exactly like this... Then McCain copied his style, he
apparently sent people to Jesse's events trying to learn from it. He
must have learned something, because he used this "straight talk"
angle against W during primaries and then against Obama during the
2008 election. He failed both times. Howard Dean used the same style
on the Democratic side, until he was done in by "[the scream](https://youtu.be/RwkNnMrsx7Q?t=46)". 

I guess straight-talk method was 1st used successfully, after Jesse,
by the Governator -who happens to be good friends with Jesse BTW-. "I
ain't got time to bleed!"

Trump is the son of a German immigrant, and you know, Germans are loud, boastful..

Ummm-No

See C. Rapaille's The Culture Code. In France the sun is male, the moon is female. In German it is the other way around, die Sonne, der Mond. In France (and in most Mediterranean countries I assume, and Russia) the male shines, is supposed to take a center stage. In Germany women shine, men are supposed to be the hang-back, silent type, they don't shine (see the fictional story Heidi, a happy little girl, and his silent, grumpy grandfather). That is the arcetype. If you try to be flippant, like this guy, you lose.  D. Chump is the furthest thing from the archetype. Oh and he is no "favorite son" or whateever, he said some shit about people here too, so rest assured, his dumb-ass is disowned. 

Question

What do you have against MTBI SPs? 

Nothing

There are some great ones. Some cultures can accentuate their negatives, they'll have a hard time at these places, but in some, and with good upbringing, they are perfectly fine. Clint Eastwood is a functioning one, he makes thoughtful movies, though his political views are a bit archaic. It took him a long time to get there though... Ben Affleck is another - great guy.

Question

What is needed to generate philosophy in today's world? 

Three Things

The budding philosopher must be good at three subjects 1) Computation, complexity theory, coding 2) Mathematical modeling, numerical computation 3) Understanding social dynamics, either through math or through inborn skill. Without these three, one cannot shoot the shit on philosophical matters  today. I'm sorry. 

Someone is going to combine all of this, do the slam-dunk.  I am not saying I am that guy, but I can see that's what it will take to get there. P != NP? Lyapunov exponent? Got to grok that biznitch. Without these how can a person generate new ideas on AI, the knowledge economy, so forth? Otherwise we'll have bunch of INTJs talking out of their ass about subject matters outside their knowledge, they have a certain skill with that, sure, but it will not be the real thing.

Question

Aren't INTJs good at theorizing?

They are

.. but they are also given to leave stuff out to "make the theory work" and these  left-out facts can break the model completely. Their motto is "I've made up my mind, don't confuse me with the facts" - their Ni (introverted intuition) works like a fuzzy Ti (introverted thinking) - it can converge on theories extremely fast, with limited knowledge. A strength in many environments, but also  a weakness in some cases.

I give an example to how an INTJ theorizes. One INTJ told me once  "a country needs an empire in their past to have a good culinary culture", Here's a theory. The idea is if there is an empire there'd be a king and queen, and cooking for the palace develops the culinary culture, knowledge would spread from there to everyone, etc., etc.. Granted, history and culinary culture was outside the field of expertise for this INTJ (his field is chemistry and the man is really smart, a genius in fact), though the model has a certain elegance, it fits a lot of data points.  But he left out one data point to make it all work.

THE BRITISH F--ING EMPIRE.

Right? I mean, when was the last time anyone went to a British Restaurant? What would the menu even be like? 1) Fish 2) Chips 3) Fish and Chips? Well... anyway. Leaving that aside, the theory could still be salvageable perhaps.., I don't know, maybe you constrain it here and there, and it can still function. 

Question 

I Am CRM type is interesting. Who has this type?
