# Bad Boys, Bad Boys, Whatcha Gonna Do?
And.. whenever I hear bad news about police matters,Â this song always plays in my head.. From the 90s reality TV show COPS. Interesting show to watch, but I wonder if it helped or hindered the discussion on policing. Did the public ponder what was being shown, or simply laugh at it, at this spectacle of an human affair?
