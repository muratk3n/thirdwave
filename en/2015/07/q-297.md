Rupert Murdoch

When will Donald Trump stop embarrassing himself and his friends?

Hilarious

For the record,  Rupert Murdoch is this guy

The paper he is holding is one of his, and the title reads "Abu's Been Sleeping in My Bed".

John Markoff

There's this wonderful counter situation to the popular belief that
there will be no jobs. The last time someone wrote about this was in
1995 when a book titled The End of Work predicted this. The decade
after that, the US economy grew faster than the population for the
next decade. It's not clear to me at all that things are going to work
out the way they felt.

Errr

Wonderful counter-situation? Here is the funny thing about that: the author Markoff refers to, Jeremy Rifkin, is not only patting himself in the back these days, he is doing victory laps because of what he wrote in that book was so extremely accurate. "Economy growing faster" is no proof there isn't unemployment, new tech has displaced workers.

I'd expect better quality from Edge. This is complete junk.

Hillary Clinton 

Enough renewables to power "every home in America".

Nice

We must wean off fossil fuels. This energy source encourages centralized / concentrated power structures, endangers the environment, and causes chaos in the Middle East.
