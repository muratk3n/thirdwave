Why do military spending cuts for Greece never seem to come to focus? Does that have something to do with Germany selling all that weaponary to Greeks?

Funny you say that

Cannot speak to the pre-crisis events, but now the reason Tippy Tippy Tsipras cannot make those cuts is because he went into coalition with Nazis - the Greek ones, because these clowns were "anti-austerity", and Tippy Tippy Tsipras wanted to "strengthen his hand" for the upcoming negotiations. The only minor nuisance about the situation was that, well  these clowns are Nazis who  like their military toys, that's how we end up with the current bizarre situation  where a leftist government cannot even cut unnecessary defense spending.
