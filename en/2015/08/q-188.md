# Q&A - 18/8
As the U.S. flag was raised at America's embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years, John Kerry called for a "genuine democracy" in Cuba and his comments were broadcast across the country in full, translated accurately into Spanish so everyone could understand.

Cubans should be free to choose their own leaders, Kerry said, telling the government to respect international norms of human rights.

Cuba's government hit back by criticizing the United States' own record on rights, but it did let its people hear Kerry.

Cool

Reestablishing relations with Cuba: great.

Are there any other pariah states left? How about North Korea? Can't the Chinese take care of these f--kers?

Cannot wait to see what these guys will produce.

Sooo is Ara under Alphabet? How about Cloud services?
