# Temparature Increase

Is the temparature real? There are many methods here; Within the
context of pure time series methods, the best chance of climate change
deniers had was arguing that temperature time series data could be
random walk. Example for RW is stock price movement where values "can
go up or down, in an unpredictable fashion". So deniers try to chalk
up the temperature increase in the past 70 years to this kind of
movement. They cannot even argue variations of random walk BTW, it has
to be pure random walk, if there is a drift, or a trend there
(indicating up movement) they are screwed.

It turns out they are statistical tests for that. We used dataset from
GISS, temperature anomalies between 1880-2010 are captured here
(anomalies are relative to the 1951-80 base period means). We used ADF
test, the implementation we used is able to test for combination of
hypothesis' -- pure RW, no pure RW no drift no trend, etc. Well, the
test shows GISS data is not pure random walk, it is random walk with a
trend (trend stationarity).

At this point deniers can try to shift gears and argue for
mean-reversion (opposite of random walk), "what goes up must come down
and vice versa" surely there is a certain amount of mean-reversion in
this data. Traders love mean-reversion by the way, and if you could
trade on temperature data wouldn't you? Hell yeah! Buy low in the
winter, sell high in the summer. But the deniers can never prove
full-mean reversion on this data, and since the ADF test blew through
all threshold values all indicators are screaming out a trend.

There are other methods as well, such as cointegration, that took care
of the attribution part of the equation. That final analysis was the
one that truly sealed the deal. It is game-over for the deniers.

Temparature anomaly data from GISS, anomalies are relative to the
1951-80 base period means.
