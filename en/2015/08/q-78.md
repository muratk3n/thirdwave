# Q&A - 7/8
Last night's debate sent Fox News' Â ratings through the roof

They managed the debate surprisingly well

They asked some hard questions, it was well managed overall. Someone I know wanted to create a drinking game around the debates - here's an idea: you drink when u hear the 'R' word: Ronald Reagan.

The candidates.. they all suck. There is only one guy even worthy of mention, but I won't name any names. A hint? It's not the paisan, it's not Trump, and it sure as f**k ain't Bush. Which means any of those three would be _great_ for Hillary. Those three guys: I support you. I'm behind you 110 percent. Go for it.
