[About the Cincinnati cop shooting and killing an unarmed black man] Cops wouldn't make "bad decisions" if "the perp didn't run away" [..] Just comply.

Hah

The problem is even if a brother doesn't (cannot) run, he might get choked to death (i.e. Eric Garner death in New York). So stay, get choked to death, run, get shot. The "perp" in Cincinnati must have thought he is better off running. You can't fault a black man trying to maximize his chances for survival.
