Very funny

Your pope is saying exactly the opposite boy. Why don't you pull ur head out ur ass and listen to what he is saying? This guy ... this is one sneaky motherlover.. He is sending "warm messages" to climate change camp but at the same time he turns to the fossil fuel lobby and says "I will let you do whatever you want, because, hell, we  are not the cause of global warming, are we?".

F**in Jeb!
