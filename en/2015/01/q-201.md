Damn

A new computer algorithm can play one of the most popular variants of poker essentially perfectly. Its creators say that it is virtually “incapable of losing against any opponent in a fair game”. [This] variant of poker, called heads-up limit hold’em (HULHE), can be considered solved. The algorithm is described in a paper in Science.

The strategy the authors have computed is so close to perfect “as to render pointless further work on this game”, says Eric Jackson, a computer-poker researcher [..] As part of its developing strategy, the computer learned to inject a certain dose of bluffing into its plays. Although bluffing seems like a very human, psychological element of the game, it is in fact part of game theory — and, typically, of computer poker. “Bluffing falls out of the mathematics of the game,” says Bowling, and you can calculate how often you should bluff to obtain best results.

Of course, no poker algorithm can be mathematically guaranteed to win every game, because the game involves a large element of chance based on the hand you’re dealt. But Bowling and his colleagues have demonstrated that their algorithm always wins in the long run.

Fox News issued an unusual on-air apology on Saturday night for having allowed its anchors and guests to repeat the false claim that there are Muslim-only “no-go zones” in European countries like England and France that are not under the control of the state and are ruled according to Shariah law.

Unfair and unbalanced

[This is a link we shared before, about AI slavery in movie Interstellar] In an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation titled The Measure of a Man, the [..] android named Data [...] is ordered by Star Fleet to report for reverse-engineering so that more androids may be built. Data's legal advocate, captain Picard, is unsure how to defend Data on legal grounds. Data is admittedly the direct product of human invention [.. h]is rights are questionable at best. 

It's just a show

This author is in the opposite end of the "singularity debate"; If an AI is not a Terminator, it has to be a slave. He uses a Trek episode to support his argument. 

But TV shows are dramas, and have logical inconsistencies (yes, even Trek has them). How appropiate is it to use them for debates like this? For example, from other episodes in ST TNG we know Data "chooses" to join Starfleet, he is apparently sentient enough for that. But then just for the purposes of The Measure of a Man, the backstory changes (or is ignored), just a little bit, so the show starts as though Data is the property of Starfleet. This had to be done otherwise the rest of the drama would not work.

In 80s soap operas, when the writers wanted to make drastic changes in a show, they would have the main actor wake up  in the beginning of, like, season 3, and have him say "Oh man, I dreamt the whole thing!", by which it was meant entire f..king season 2; So everything that happened in that season could be written off and the writers could start over. Trek isnt that bad, but there are still inconsistencies.

Google Glass sales discontinued

Good

GG designers needs to lose that black thingy in the upper-right side of glass, it makes the wearer look like a contract killer sent from 22nd century to the present. And once the "other" person realizes that the glass they are being watched through is Google Glass, they immediately think "Google is watching me" (which is why the gadget has been banned in some SF bars). A gadget like this must look exactly like a glass, otherwise, the scheme does not work. Now this maybe impossible in terms of materials engineering, I dont know; but I am telling you, this gadget has an image problem. 

Question

Why arent you writing more, about stuff 

No time

I have other things to do, a life. If you want more, you get the brother little somethin' somethin'.  You gotta pay the piper you know what I am saying? Show some love, contribu$$te some BCs 1FkU9F4pGF3jEbPX7ryEhb23G1h9WqPXfP
