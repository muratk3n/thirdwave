French cartoon magazine was targeted for publishing cartoons of prophet Mohammad.

It is ironic

It's a known historical fact that Mohammed did not want his pictures, likeness to be portrayed in any shape of form -- bcz he did not want these images to be worshipped (his new "way" was about tearing down idols u see). Now, in the mind of some, the absence of pictures are becoming a source of worship and ironically becoming  another form of idol, then he becomes deity by omission, in a way like god, not described, painted, represented in any shape of form. I dont think this is what he had intended.

It should be fine to draw Mohammed now, in today's world no single image can become "the truth" anyway, we are not living in modern times, where single channel, single description, single explanation ruled above all else. The preoccupation of some Muslims on such stupid matters on the other hand, has a lot to do with the fact that they still did not shake off their cultural tie to centralized, concentrated Roman / Ottoman barbarism where the former's connection to Catholic Church plagues it even today, and the latter (along with the former) where meant for peasant population and meant to rule over donkeys not people. This is the backdrop that organizations such as ISIS find their adherents.
