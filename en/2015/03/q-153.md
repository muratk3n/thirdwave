# Q&A - 13/3

Larry Summers 

Whether it is robots in manufacturing, automated check-out of retail establishments, e-shopping taking people out of distribution networks, information technology replacing what used to be done by low-level, white-collar managerial and clerical labor, the ability to take blood pressure and perform other medical tests with much less human labor input, automated call-center systems – it appears that technology is permitting very large-scale substitutions [..].

Technology in my judgment has likely been an important factor [for rising income inequality], and I suspect is likely to be a substantial factor pushing toward more inequality in the future [..].

The rise of the top 1 percent is likely very tied up with technology. When George Eastman [founder of Kodak] had a fantastic idea for photography, he got quite rich, and the city of Rochester became a flourishing city for generations, supporting thousands of middle-class workers. When Steve Jobs [and Wozniak, let's not forget] had had remarkable ideas, he and his colleagues made a very large fortune, but there was much less left over – there was no flourishing middle class that followed in their wake. So, understanding what's happened to the top 1 percent is important in understanding the overall picture.

Yes

History

In 1978 [the leader of China] Deng Xiaoping was on a state visit in Singapore [..] Deng was curious about what the Singaporeans had 
done to develop their country so rapidly [.., and] he confesse[d to Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of today's Singapore] that he doubted 
whether China would ever become as successful as Singapore. Lee 
reportedly replied, “we, the Singapore Chinese, were the descendants 
of illiterate landless peasants from Guangdong and Fujian in south 
China, whereas the scholars, mandarins, and literati had stayed and left
 their progeny in China. There was nothing that Singapore had done that 
China could not do, and do better.”

Hah

The story is Xiaoping was so effected by Yew's comments that it became one of the reasons China started to change. But was Yew correct? I believe the real advantage Singapore had was not having too much history; it made them more agile. China, overburdened with history could not do anything different, for a long time.

Roughly one third of the  food produced in the world for human 
consumption every year — approximately 1.3  billion tonnes — gets lost 
or wasted.

Big waste

George Orwell

It is curious to reflect that out of al the ‘experts’ of all the schools, there was not a single one who was able to foresee so likely an event as the Russo-German Pact of 1939 [..] A few writers of conservative tendency, such as Peter Drucker [emphasis mine] foretold an agreement between Germany and Russia, but they expected an actual alliance or amalgamation which would be permanent. No Marxist or other left-wing writer, of whatever colour, came anywhere near foretelling the Pact.

Nice

Orwell quoting Drucker! It feels like seeing a reference to Macbeth in the Illiad. Probably the reason that feeling is that Orwell, being the influential figure that he is, comes accross as if he should be from an earlier age. Drucker, because he talked a lot about hi-tech, the knowledge economy and management feels like should be younger. But Orwell lived btw 1903-1950, Drucker was born at 1909, and lived until 2005. 

The Economist

A recent paper, by Lauren Cohen, Umit Gurun and Scott Kominers, suggests that the rise in patent-related litigation has not really helped protect the rights of inventors. The authors collected a comprehensive dataset on non-practicing entities (NPE), relevant patents and lawsuits between NPEs for the period 2001 and 2011. The paper's authors found that rather than acting as benevolent patent enforcers, NPEs simply target the firms with the most cash—however good or bad their argument that a patent has been infringed is. For example, the probability of being sued by NPEs doubles after a firm experiences a sudden increase in its cash balance. Patent trolls are also more likely to go after firms that employ fewer lawyers. And the largest NPEs are the worst offenders. 

Economists say that patent trolls can play a useful role by helping to transfer the profit generated by patents from manufacturers to inventors. But the new research finds that inventors only receive 5% of their patent’s value after successful infringement cases. The rest goes to lawyers and NPEs that do not engage in innovation. 

In effect, this damages productivity by punishing innovators for 
their success. The authors find in their data that firms that lost 
lawsuits against patent trolls or settled out of court spent on average 
$211m less on research and development than firms that won. This meant 
that they were also less likely to conduct research that produced new 
patents in the future. Because economic growth is fuelled by innovative 
firms boosting their productivity, these disincentives could be holding 
back the wider economy.

I don't trust Bitcoin because it went through a bubble phase

There was a reason for that 

From The Age of Cryptocurrency, pg 262:

The mania’s starting point was in March 2013, with what we’ll call the Cypriot bump. The tiny island nation of Cyprus [..] fell into the grip of a financial crisis because its banks, their cash balances swollen with deposits from wealthy Russians seeking a tax haven, had invested heavily in the bonds of neighboring Greece. That larger neighbor had become the basket case of the European Union, which had just forced the government in Athens to impose a “haircut,” or mandated losses, on its investors. The EU did this to ensure that private-sector investors who’d made risky bets on Greece shouldered some of the burden of the bailout that German and other euro-zone taxpayers were bearing. Cyprus’s overleveraged banks were an unintended casualty of that and were now faced with the terrifying threat of a bank run by their large Russian depositors.

The dramatic solution [..] was that the government in Nicosia would freeze deposits and confiscate 10 percent of them to pay for a bank bailout. This unprecedented step sent shock waves around the world. “If they can do that there, they can do it anywhere,” yelled Mark McGowan, a London cabbie famous for his profanity-laced YouTube videos, where he rants about topical matters under the moniker chunkymark, all delivered from his cab. The Cyprus rant is one of his all-time classics [..] He wasn’t the only one thinking that.

Suddenly, bitcoin’s “value proposition” was clear. The government might be able to take money out of your local bank account, but it couldn’t touch your bitcoin. The Cyprus crisis sparked a stampede of money into bitcoin, which was now seen as a safe haven from the generalized threat of government confiscation everywhere. The price went from $33 at the end of February to $230 on April 9, pushing bitcoin’s total market capitalization through $1 billion for the first time, but also setting off one of the wildest yearlong rides that any financial asset has ever seen. 

News 

This week Google shared details about a Project Ara store through which users will be able to buy snap-on hardware blocks for the customizable smartphone. 

Are you kidding me? 

Google is doing that too? Is there anything cool that Google is not involved in, that's what I wanna know..

Note: We all remember the Phonebloks video released some time ago. PB and Ara  sometimes collaborate apparently, but are seperate entities.

Question

Where does the wave picture of the blog come from?
