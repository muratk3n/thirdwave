Question

Why do US governments refer to what happened to Armenians during WWI
as "Medz Yeghern" which means "the great calamity" in Armenian?

It's a middle ground

This is a word that tries to balance political correctness with
keeping a NATO ally happy with keeping Armenians (somewhat) satisfied,
just so all parties can avoid that bad word genocide.

Romanian girl

They say in my country, "Italian women are beautiful. Half of them are
from Romania"

Wonder where that saying came from
