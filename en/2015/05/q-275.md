[O]dd that dystopia assumes govt is most technologically advanced group in society when in reality they are the opposite


Hah

US Navy

Navy researchers at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Materials Science and Technology Division, demonstrate proof-of-concept of novel NRL technologies developed for the recovery of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) from seawater and conversion to a liquid hydrocarbon fuel [..].

The predicted cost of jet fuel using these technologies is in the range of $3-$6 per gallon, and with sufficient funding and partnerships, this approach could be commercially viable within the next seven to ten years. Pursuing remote land-based options would be the first step towards a future sea-based solution [..].

Navy researchers demonstrate proof-of-concept in first flight of an internal combustion powered model aircraft fueled by a novel gas-to-liquid process that uses seawater as carbon feedstock.

Huh

Did you just say "we used sea water as fuel and it costs as cheap as regular oil and we used it to fly a fricking model plane"? Are u f**king kidding me dude? Why isn't this big news yet?
