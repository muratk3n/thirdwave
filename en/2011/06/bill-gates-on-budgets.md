# Bill Gates on Budgets

https://youtu.be/jiUKpX09zo4

Scary and crazy but true. I think the problem outlined above is
exactly the same as the one in Wutburger; the decisions are made over
people's heads, in the case of Wutburger, they protest, in the case of
state budgets people stopped caring long time ago. But in both cases
the problem is systemic. The system is too concentrated, too
centralized for any regular person to wrap his / her head around or
hold someone accountable in its entirety. We could allocate budgets
per project, our technology allows this, with ppl voting for each
budget item. The current democratic process is too coarse, too broad,
too industrial. You vote for one person, and by definition you end up
voting for all her projects, present and future. We need better
granularity.
