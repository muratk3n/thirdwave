# Average Teachers

Here is why we should fire all teachers and rely solely on Internet for transmission of knowledge on predefined subjects. Scientifically, the majority of teachers will be average.

Say we measure a quantifiable attribute on humans, such as height, wealth, IQ. If we plot the frequency of these measurements, the resulting graph will be either a Normal distribution or Pareto distribution.

There are logical explanations for both of these resuts -- if a lot of factors contribute to the formation of a single measurement, that measurement tends to be distributed normally, just as you throw bunch of dice, its sum tends to be distributed normally.

Pareto distribution has to do with scale, and / or network effects, and is also explainable logically.

Now, both of these distributions share one thing in common. High values are rare, average and low values dominate.

The conclusion is, if we measured the teaching effectiveness of teachers and plotted its frequence, we would see the same result, good teachers would be rare, average teachers would dominate.

And in the Knowledge Age, we cannot afford our children to be educated by average people.

That is why we should get rid of teachers. We can rely on the Internet to distribute content which is created people who are on the "extremes", i.e. extremely knowledgeable on a subject. For example Youtube channel Khanacademy is created by someone who used mathematics in his daily work (Mr. Khan worked for a hedge fund) -- not by someone whose primary concern was only to educate. Which teacher can beat MIT professor Gilbert Strang's lectures on Linear Algebra? The man is one of the best in that subject, does research, does consulting on it. I would not want to subject my children to an average lecture by an average teacher on Linear Algebra when I know Strang's lecture is out there, free and readily available on the click of a button.

Then the conclusion is, paying many teachers to teach a subject is a waste of time and money.
