# First Obama Osama Rap Song
First rap song I've seen on YouTube on Obama vs Osama. One 'c' word, couple 'd' words.. not too bad ('n' word all the way tho).  I liked HNIC, and fried chicken stuff. What's with the watermelon? I am sure it's a new streotype and I am sure it's funny as hell."Guess who's gettin' reelected?" ... Crazy shit.
