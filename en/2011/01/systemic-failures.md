# Systemic Failures

All aspects of 19th-century-style industrial structures, organizations and mindset are under attack [1]. 2008 mortgage crisis, Katrina, BP oil leak disaster are all signs of this. Here is a rule of thumb to identify systemic risks: You wont be able to blame anyone.

Right? Who can we blame for 2008 mortgage crisis? Surely you can prepare a list, but it will be a mile long but no one on the list will be completely responsible. That's a sign that the problem is systemic.

Was BP responsible for the oil leak fiasco? BP is certainly not the first oil company to cause accidents during drilling. The problem is that the smokstack mindset needs / knows / likes "concentrated" energy sources, like oil, and due to Peak Oil theory, most of the easy oil wells have been drilled already, and now we need to drill more and more in dangerous environments. In other words, drilling accidents take place same as before, but now when they occur, they cause environmental disasters because they are in more sensitive areas. How can any regulation control this? It cannot [2]. Just like it could not control 2008 mortgage crisis.

The problems we are witnessing are signs of modernity's collapse. We wont be able to identify an easy culprit, wont be able to point finger to a single entity. These problems wont be solved without a complete overhaul of the system.

[1] Hi-tech industrial production is different from 19th century production BTW. Today's production has high amount of knowledge input and requires less human labor. Therefore socially, it does not require the kind of central, standardized, maximization driven organizational, modernist thinking. Hardware is becoming more like software actually, easily outsourced, versioned, and one day, even printed in 3D. So let's not confuse 19th century industrial mindset with 21st. Also remember that the nation-state concept is a product of 19th century industrialization.

[2] Modern bureucracies are smokestack creations. They are hierarchical, built according to "boxes and channels" mindset. Knowledge is split on the way down, collected together on the way up. However today's nonlinear world and problems fill certain boxes beyond their capacity, do not touch some, and almost always require more than one box to be involved (so why have boxes ?) People's lives have become more varied, complicated and fast-paced. Today's workforce is in white collar jobs, not blue collar, people do not go to work 9 to 5, and do not have nuclear families (the percentage of nuclear family is below 30% in United States).
