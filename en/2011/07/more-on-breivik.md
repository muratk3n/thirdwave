# More on Breivik

Feeling victimized and wanting to lash out is the key on this guy. We can add that on top of the things we've said earlier. Once he decides that, he starts planning, wants to create drama, be independent ... in a crazy way. Victimization was also an issue with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (of Columbine fame). They were bullied in high school, felt like victims and wanted to lash out. In terms of profile, Harris appears to be a Emotion Junkie like Breivik but that's the only profile match [1].

I come back to the systemic failure issue: Harris and Klebold are put in the same place with bullies (the latter being most likely blood type O Artisans, the former blood type A,B Idealist or Rationals). Breivik who is very smart has no outlet for his mind except for planning killings. Whereever you look, it's failure... this is clusterfuck at systemic level. The system is too moronic, one-size-fits-all to help people as individuals. People are shoved through the system as if they are some piece of meat. Harris and Klebold should have been seperated from the rest in high school, left alone (not *taught*) to do their own thing. Breivik's of the world need to know what their limitations are, what they need to work on, in a constructive way.

[1] Ted Kaczynski is a match on Retreater however who, it seems, was an inspiration for Breivik. I'd like to add though, a single type is not enough on its own, and should not be used for discrimination.
