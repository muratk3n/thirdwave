# Blaxploitation
The train of thought started while I was listening to J. J. Johnson's song Willie Chase (great funk) --  I looked up the song, and started reading about blaxploitation movies. There are subgenres, and one subgenre is .. Westerns!  An example is titled (I kid you not) "Boss Ni...r". Ex-football player Fred Williamson plays a sheriff, and the movie's slogan goes: "White Man's Town.. Black Man's Law".Hillarious. Note: I guess the N word was not politically incorrect at this time. Not sure when this word became a slur actually;  Richard Pryor was using it during 70s, he was both pissing off some people, but he wasnt really aware that he was... So I guess the society took some deciding the issue.
