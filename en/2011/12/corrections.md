# Update

MBTI Stat tool is getting better as I get better data... We have some new MBTI results: Richard Feynman ENTP, Mark Zuckerberg INTJ, Sergey Brin INTJ, Larry Page ENTJ. For Z -- dude can apparently sit on a computer for 20 hours non-stop, that kind of mind-body disconnect is unique to INTJs; the two highest functions Ni, Te take over and outside world loses importance during "work". Another INTJ is Bill Gates -- in fact the poster boy for this type.

It is easy to confuse INTJ with NF Idealists sometimes, because both are driven to do some good for people (however they define that to be) but for INTJ the push comes from Fi (introverted feeling) that shapes the higher functions, for NFs helping people is an overall, existential goal. However tools, approach (utilitarianism, strategy over diplomacy) differ greatly between two groups.
