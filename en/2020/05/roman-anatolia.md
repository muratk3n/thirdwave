# Roman Turks

The tigger mythology talks a lot about Turks coming from Central Asia
and settling to current Anatolia. In reality the small number of
people who came were assimilated into the existing culture of Anatolia
which is an extension of Rome and Byzantium whose culmination was the
Ottomans that is correctly labeled as Third Rome by some.

There are reason why these so-called Turks are marked as "outsiders"
in the current nationalist narrative. As Gellner (who wrote the book
on nationalism) [says](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2013/03/allegience-of-pion.html),

>Nationalism is not what it seems, and above all it is not what it
 seems to itself. The cultures it claims to defend and revive are
 often its own inventions, or are modified out of all
 recognition. [.. While it is being created] nationalism uses the
 pre-existing, historically inherited proliferation of cultures or
 cultural wealth, though it uses them very selectively, and it most
 often transforms them radically. Dead languages can be revived,
 traditions invented, quite fictitious pristine purities restored
 [..]. The cultural shreds and patches used by nationalism are often
 arbitrary historical inventions. Any old shred and patch would have
 served as well [..].

Here is what happened. When Ottocuck went down, the Balkans were lost,
whatever was "here" was bad. So the fictitious pristine, the pure is
became Central Asia, so the founders wanted to associate themselves
with that pure, with something outside the current region, and
conveniently blame the loss of Balkans, and other regional troubles on
"others" who were "the wrong Turks anyway".

"Well but the language became this and that after Turks arrived". The
language is not a cultural indicator. After former Yugoslavia split,
everyone who fought eachother during the 90s spoke the same
language. US and Britain speak the same language, but their culture is
very different (Americans are more like Germans).
