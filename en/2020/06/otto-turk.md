# Turks, Culture, National Narrative

What is culture, national narrative? How is the interplay?

Brain is made-up of three layers; the reptilian brain, culture codes
and intellect. Any group of people staying at a geography long enough
will converge to a common sets of codes. This happens organically,
wout anyone telling a kid how things are, it does not happen through
modern education, or through stories told by a parent, or an uncle. It
is an osmosis at a gargantuan level where an infant sucks in all
available information at a young age from everything, and everyone
around him, bcz this info is needed to fit in. Such task could not be
outsourced to a single person, or few persons. The entire society, the
life itself plays a part.

The codes are cemented near age 7 and locked in.

National narrative is something else, it is but a weak paint on top of
existing structure. It can be changed, ignored, it can help or hinder
a national narrative. Nationalism is second-wave, so narrative
inescapably carries certain central, concentrated tendencies -- it is
in a country's interest to make this narrative as sensible as
possible, and it should be compatible with the culture codes of a
populace. If not, it will be ignored, ridiculed, or worse create
pathologies among the intellectuals.

What is the culture of the people of Anatolia? Simple, it is the
culture of that particular geography, Surely some pre-agro codes like
everyone else, then it invented organized agriculture first, so it
carries some of that baggage, but also has some decentralized airs
being away from most "ancient" centers in the beginning of written
history. Its governance culture is inescapably Roman however, bcz it
was smack in the middle of Rome II and III, Byzantium and Ottomans
which would have infected the people through a peasant/palace dynamic.

Everyone who came to these lands, assimilated into this culture. 

The latest national narrative is the crazy part. 1923 was probably the
worst time to found a Republic. Ethnic nationalism was on the rise,
WWI was over, WWII was not, and here is the Anatolians trying to
tailor a new national narrative for themselves. The existing
structures around Ottomans had imploded along with the
empire. Balkans, Middle Eastern "vassals" were gone, each worrying
about their own nationalities. The founders needed an identity to
inspire people, to make them forget about the "here and now" so they
chose something "outside". This was the Turk. He was from Central
Asia, and he was the ideal, the pure.

Sadly this was a bad choice. This particular ethnicity was never known
as imagined then, usually it would be conflated with religion, and/or
(rightfully) to the few number of *Turkomans* who arrived at a some
point, and settled in Anatolia in a particular region. Within the ball
busting ethnic relations the particular word's standing wasn't that
hot either, the ethnic label could even be considered a slur, no more
than 100 years ago.

Best account of this comes from an officer in the Ottoman army. At the
last days of the empire the new nationalism was circulating among the
cadres, and he wanted to check how much the regular soldiers knew of
"their identity". He starts easy, first asks them about the sultan,
the Caliph, etc. The soldiers weren't really sure, many were confused,
they thought sultan was prophet, Caliph was God, etc.  the answers
were a big mess. Frustrated, the officer asks "but aren't we all
Turks!??". They knew the answer to that one. The responded, in unison
with the word *estaÄŸfurullah*. Let me try to translate what this
means... Say your friend drops something, or makes a mistake, and says
"ah I'm such a putz", and this is the word you use. It's like "oh
c'mon", "don't sell yourself short", forgive urself. IT CAN'T BE THAT
BAD.

So today's identity is pretty much hallow. One could say "well if it
works keep it". I could go along with that, but a portion of the
country did not embrace the identity which is seen as a prerequisite
for citizenship, that puts these ppl at odds with the state. Kurds are
the best example, I am sure when their elites heard of these fairy
tales first, they must have said "waaat we come from central whaaat? I
don't __think__ so". That bullshit would never fly with them. Some
groups could go along, ignore, lip sync to it, but Kurds definitely
could not. Which made them the odd man out. They are hounded ever
since. But this is not their fault.

How does the narrative compare to other countries? Here is portion of
the US narrative; "Why did we seperate from England?". "Because ruling
from a distance was not effective". Makes sense.

Here is what TR text claims why it lost during World War I. Uh, like,
our big ally Germany lost, so we lost, indirectly, *by association*.
This sounds like a B-movie tough guy routine. I wanted-a smash-a but
they would not-a let meeee! It is not only wrong, it is childish. 

Let's not get into stories around wolves, weird treks out of nowhere
to f-ck knows where, whose at least wolf part sound awefully like
inspired by the Romulus and Remus story, two lost babies who were
suckled by a she-wolf, which was the beginning of the Roman legend (as
much as a lie as TR version). Delusional nats today making a variation
of the heavy metal sign extended two mid fingers (wolves nose) are on
this particular drug. Sadly, not even my people's fairy tales are
original.

The solution

The solution lies in the identity having to change. Name it
Anatolians, New Galatians, South Eurasians, whatever. It needs to be
something that signifies *the place*, instead of a weird ethnicity
that noone can truly define.

Addition

Question: Why do we hear some lastnames that have the word "Turk" in
them in TR?"

When the state came up with its delusional origin story, some ppl took
as their lastname something Turkic, to make themselves friendly to the
state. The lastnames are quite comical, walking turk, born soldier, or
my favorite: soldier turk. Then, by implication, the Turkic lastnames
can be taken to indicate a certain unawareness of history on the part
of that family, due to lack of education, being far from the center,
etc. It is sad in a way, the names scream not only "I am a pleb" they
try to scream "I am *your* pleb".

I am certain once the descendants realize how foolish their ancestors
have been to chose these stupid shit of names, they will rush to legal
services __en masse__ to have them changed. One day.

Nationalism in many countries, but especially in TR, is like a
reverse-telephone game. The guy at the end of the line hears the
message much more clearly than the people in the beginning of the
line. The people at the beginning, closer to circle, know the nuances,
warts, and get around stuff. The guy at the end drinks the Kool-Aid,
becomes the true believer.

Obivously one of the founders Kemal took the name Ataturk (Father of
all Turks) himself, so he was setting an example. But he was always
more into this stuff than others in his circle. He reportedly told an
American journalist who was visiting "you are also a Turk (because
everyone was)" which flummuxed the man. Kemal went to some odd places
with this, the last thing he came up was a weird Sun-Language-Theory
that many researchers could not make sense of. After his death the
theory was quitely shelved, a minister would answer when asked why
this was done, with "what good is the Sun-Language-Theory after the
Sun has set?".
