<h1>Kurds</h1>
<p>1920s</p>
<p>During TR's foundation there were some warm signals sent towards Kurds
who were, at least on paper, seen as equal founders of the
Republic. Such closeness would not be surprising since both peoples
fought in the war of liberation and even partook in the "bad events"
that "befell" the Armeanians in the East. But, as any astute observer
at the time could point out, knowing the ethnic nationalistic roots of
the new Republic and some of its most visible founders, things would
evolve to a different point later on. Evolve to a different point they
soon did.</p>
<p>After 1925 Sheikh Said rebellion and subsequent reforms, by 1933 Kemal
would utter the words <em>ne mutlu türküm diyene</em> (happy is who can say I
am a turk) in a speech with clear subtext that ppl who could not make
such claims would perhaps be unhappy (?) and take the last name
Ataturk himself in 1934, cementing ethnic nationalism in TR.</p>
<p>1960s</p>
<p>After 1960 coup naturally the state reverted to factory settings. A
young Kurdish student Dengir Firat reports, who did not care much of
his ethnic origin during those days, did not speak the language, was
from an affluent Kurdish family would see a poster one day carrying
the words of the then President that read "whoever says I am a Kurd,
spit on his face!". He would decide he learn Kurdish the next day, and
also pursue politics shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>1977</p>
<p>An armed leftist terrorist organization named PKK is formed. Tho their
roots and methods were Marxist they were largely influenced by ethnic
encroachement by their hegemon country in their region,
Kurdistan. From [1]; "It is also possible that the PKK's nationalism
was all the more virulent because its founders sought to recreate an
identity they felt they had lost. They were not alone: across the
Middle East religious and ethnic groups that felt the loss of
traditional identity through modernization or state attempts to
homogenize society, sought to rediscover it through a revivalism that
invoked an imaginary past. For the PKK the intensity of Kurdish
national feeling was accentuated by the loss of spoken Kurdish among
its founding members.</p>
<p>In 1977 [.. they..] identified the enemies of the Kurdish people as
the fascists (Greywolves and similar groups); agents of the state and
those who supported them; the Turkish Left which subordinated the
Kurdish question to the leftist revolution and finally the
exploitative Kurdish landlord class".</p>
<p>1980s</p>
<p>The fascist coup of 1980 doubles down on nationalistic identity and
opresses Kurds even more. In the infamous Diyarbakir prison many Kurds
are tortured, whose suffering would fuel the PKK backlash many times
over. "The hell of 90s" in terms of their counterattack would be
fueled with the opression felt throughout the 80s.</p>
<p>Among the regular public during this time the coup would opress even
the mention of the word Kurd, in any publication. Growing up in this
era I can attest; I did not even know Kurds <em>existed</em> until well in my
teens, perhaps twenties. I laughed many years later when I heard a
politician named Selahattin Demirtaş reported the same experience,
this is (tragic) funny because Demirtaş himself is a Kurd!  I guess
his parents were scared, did not speak the language at home, did not
mention the identity to him with the fear of him slipping up, didn't
let their children know, so it went.</p>
<p>2015</p>
<p>A Kurdish party HDP led by Selahattin Demirtaş would gain &gt;10% of the
votes, putting them in a kingmaker position. If democracy was followed
they could extract some concessions in return for some cultural
rights, strengthen localities, and be represented in the greater body
politic. The nationalists refused, along with deep state actors terror
attacks were triggered, scaring regular people and voters, which
raised the votes of the party in gov. Election was repeated in a after
a disgusting theather, which gave the gov back its majority. Since
this method worked, trading democracy for votes in an atmosphere of
scaremongering, they continued, even intensified resulting with the
eventual jailing of Demirtaş, and many of his party members.</p>
