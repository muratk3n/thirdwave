# Crowd Wisdom

"At a country fair .. 800 people participated in a contest to estimate
the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis
Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate
within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pound"

It sounds magical, bunch of people seemingly throwing out numbers and
their average works. How come? Here is how. Humans already have
built-in knowledge about the visual-look-weight connection on many
items, so their guesses will be already close enough to the real
thing, with some noise associated. The distribution of that noise will
be bell-shaped (Gaussian). This is important, bcz if normally
distributed, averaging such guesses, even with erros, fixes the error.

This technique even works internally sometimes, it is called "the
wisdom of the crowd within". "[Researchers] asked participants for
point estimates of continuous quantities associated with general world
knowledge, such as '[w]hat percentage of the world's airports are in
the United States?' [then] half of the participants were immediately
asked to make a second, different guess in response to the same
question [..t]he average of a participant's two guesses was more
accurate than either individual guess"

"Can't we use the same idea for policy, like millions making policy?"

No. For judging the weight of something, we already have perhaps
inborn, at the very least life-long experience there... During our
lives we have handled, touched, carried things, so looking at an
object we can make weight guesses. The estimate will have noise but it
won't be far off from the truth which can be corrected
statistically. Policy is not something people are engaged in
daily. Which makes it a speciality. Averaging among specialists will
work, not among everyone.
