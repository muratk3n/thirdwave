# Numbers on H2 Energy

Gasoline

1 gallon is 2.56 kg. In Europe the gasoline price is about 9 dollar
per gallon, or 3.51 dollar / kg.

H2

1 kg has energy of 39.7 kWh (143 MJ).

Personal Consumption

10 KW / person, based on first world standards.

HFC Cars

A Nexo tank carries 210 kWh of energy. The car can travel 756 km on a
full tank [3], the tank capacity is 6.33 kg. There are actually three
tanks, each at 10,000 psi [4]. 

Solar panels

Panels can produce

1000 W/m2

Electrolysis

Current best processes for water electrolysis (PEM or alkaline
electrolysis) have an effective electrical efficiency of 70–80%,
producing 1 kg of hydrogen requires 50–55 kW⋅h of electricity
[1]. Solar to H2 eff 30% [5].



BEV

The EV has an overall efficiency of about 60%. Electric grid
efficiency is 40%, 60% x 40% gives a total of 24%. 

Desalination

Energy consumption [2] of seawater desalination has reached as low as 3 kWh/$m^3$,
