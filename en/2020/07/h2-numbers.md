# Numbers on H2 Energy

BEV

The EV has an overall efficiency of about 60%. Electric grid
efficiency is 40%, 60% x 40% gives a total of 24%. 

H2 ve BE

Assuming same electricity comes from panels to both processes,
electrolysis is 70%, pipeline transfer is 97%, for FC car efficiency
34% efficient (same as gasoline car). For BE let's say they store
electricity 100% on some battery, lose 60% while transferring, and 40%
in the car,

```python
print (0.70*0.97*0.34) # h2
print (1.00*0.40*0.60) # be

Gasoline

1 gallon is 2.56 kg. In Europe the gasoline price is about 9 dollar
per gallon, or 3.51 dollar / kg.

H2

1 kg has energy of 39.7 kWh (143 MJ).

Personal Consumption

10 KW / person, based on first world standards.

HFC Cars

A Nexo tank carries 210 kWh of energy. The car can travel 756 km on a
full tank [3], the tank capacity is 6.33 kg. There are actually three
tanks, each at 10,000 psi [4].

For the Toyota Mirai, the energy capacity of the fuel-cell vehicle's 5
kilograms of hydrogen, compressed at 10,000 psi, is more than 150
kilowatt-hours [5]. Max range 500 km, 1848 weight, 

```python
F = 1.848*200
w = (F*500*1000) / 3600.
print ( w / (150*1000) )

Solar panels

Panels can produce

1000 W/m2

Electrolysis

Current best processes for water electrolysis (PEM or alkaline
electrolysis) have an effective electrical efficiency of 70–80%,
producing 1 kg of hydrogen requires 50–55 kW⋅h of electricity
[1]. 

Ammonia

11 MWh/ton ammonia can be generated by renewable energy, solar, tidal,
or wind. "Crackers" that generate H2 from ammonia are about 76%
efficient [6].


Desalination

Energy consumption [2] of seawater desalination has reached as low as 3 kWh/$m^3$,
