# Numbers on H2 Energy

<a name='lithium'/>

Lithium

There is >60kg of lithium carbonate in a 70kWh battery. 400 liters of
water is used per kilo of lithium [7]. Water is a problem bcz while
lithium rich water is pumped, potable water resources also shift.

The entire world reserve for lithium is estimated to be ~17 million
tonnes.

If everyone used batteries to store energy, below is the amt of
lithium needed.. Single person consumes 10 KW of energy, 240 Kwh /
day, to hold the energy required for a day, for everyone,

```python
consumption = 10 # kw, per person
pop = 7.8e9 # world population
daily_world_consumption = consumption*24*pop # kwh
kg_lit_needed = daily_world_consumption / 70.0 * 60.0
print ('needed', int(kg_lit_needed / 1e9)) # billion kg, million ton
```

```text
needed 1604
```

Required litihum is over 90 TIMES of available reserves.

How about today's energy consumption? According to
[EIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) ,
estimated world energy consumption was 157,481 Terrawatt Hours in
2013.

```python
consumed = (157481. / (365*2)) * 1e9 # Kwh
print ("%d mil. tons" % (consumed / 70.0 * 60.0 / 1e9))
```

```text
184 mil. tons
```

Storing today's energy consumption for half a day would require over
ten times the amount of available lithium in the world.


BEV

The EV has an overall efficiency of about 60%. Electric grid
efficiency is 40%, 60% x 40% gives a total of 24%.


H2 ve BE

Assuming same electricity comes from panels to both processes,
electrolysis is 70%, pipeline transfer is 97%, for FC car efficiency
34% efficient (same as gasoline car). For BE let's say they store
electricity 100% on some battery, lose 60% while transferring, and 40%
in the car,

```python
print (0.70*0.97*0.34) # h2
print (1.00*0.40*0.60) # be
```

Gasoline

1 gallon is 2.56 kg. In Europe the gasoline price is about 9 dollar
per gallon, or 3.51 dollar / kg.

H2

1 kg has energy of 39.7 kWh (143 MJ).

Personal Consumption

10 KW / person, based on first world standards.

HFC Cars

A Nexo tank carries 210 kWh of energy. The car can travel 756 km on a
full tank [3], the tank capacity is 6.33 kg. There are actually three
tanks, each at 10,000 psi [4].

For the Toyota Mirai, the energy capacity of the fuel-cell vehicle's 5
kilograms of hydrogen, compressed at 10,000 psi, is more than 150
kilowatt-hours [5]. Max range 500 km, 1848 weight, 

```python
F = 1.848*200
w = (F*500*1000) / 3600.
print ( w / (150*1000) )
```

Solar panels

Panels can produce

1000 W/m2

Electrolysis

Current best processes for water electrolysis (PEM or alkaline
electrolysis) have an effective electrical efficiency of 70–80%,
producing 1 kg of hydrogen requires 50–55 kW⋅h of electricity
[1]. 

Ammonia

11 MWh/ton ammonia can be generated by renewable energy, solar, tidal,
or wind. "Crackers" that generate H2 from ammonia are about 76%
efficient [6].

Desalination

Energy consumption [2] of seawater desalination has reached as low as 3 kWh/$m^3$,
