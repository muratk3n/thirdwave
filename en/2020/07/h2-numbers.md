# Numbers on H2 Energy

Lithium

There is >60kg of lithium carbonate in a 70kWh battery. 400 liters of
water is used per kilo of lithium [7]. Water is a problem bcz while
lithium rich water is pumped, potable water resources also shift.

The entire world reserve for lithium is estimated to be ~17 million
tonnes.

If everyone used batteries to store energy, below is the amt of
lithium needed.. Single person consumes 10 KW of energy, 240 Kwh /
day, to hold the energy required for a day, for everyone,

```python
consumption = 10 # kw, per person
pop = 7.8e9 # world population
daily_world_consumption = consumption*24*pop # kwh
kg_lit_needed = daily_world_consumption / 70.0 * 60.0
print ('needed', int(kg_lit_needed / 1e9)) # billion kg, million ton
```

```text
needed 1604
```

Required litihum is over 90 TIMES of available reserves.

How about today's energy consumption? According to
[EIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) ,
estimated world energy consumption was 157,481 Terrawatt Hours in
2013.

```python
consumed = (157481. / (365*2)) * 1e9 # Kwh
print ("%d mil. tons" % (consumed / 70.0 * 60.0 / 1e9))
```

```text
184 mil. tons
```

Storing today's energy consumption for half a day would require over
ten times the amount of available lithium in the world.

BEV, Electricity

The EV has an overall efficiency of about 60%. Electric grid
efficiency is 40%, 60% x 40% gives a total of 24%.

<a name='ukcar'/>

UK drove 303.7 billion miles in 2013. Take miles driven in half a day
and assume energy it is stored in bat, with range 250 miles per 75 kwh
bat, and 60kg of lithium per 70kWh,

```python
mday = 303e9 / (365.*2)
lit = (mday / 250 * 60 / 1e3)
print ("%d tons" % lit)
print ("%0.2f mil tons needed globally" % (lit * 113 / 1e6))
```

```text
99616 tons
11.26 mil tons needed globally
```

given that UK has 113 of world population... If driving patterns
double, world is screwed. Not much lith left over for freight, air
travel, home usage, and the like.

H2 ve BE

Assuming same electricity comes from panels to both processes,
electrolysis is 80%, pipeline transfer is 97%, for FC car efficiency
34% efficient (same as gasoline car). For BE let's say they store
electricity 100% on some battery, lose 60% while transferring, and 40%
in the car,

```python
print (0.80*0.97*0.34) # h2
print (1.00*0.40*0.60) # be
```

Pipelines can transmit 10 times the energy at one-eighth the costs
associated with electricity transmission lines [8]. Verification; take
10 m/s gas flow, at 350 bars density H2 is 28 kg/m3, assuming a pipe
output area of 1 m2, energy density of 33.6 kWh/kg. Compare it with a
standard tower [9] which is a 765 kV line can reliably transmit
2200-2400 MW [10].

```python
dens = 33.6 # kWh/kg
kg_vol = 28 # kg/m^3 at 350 bars
v = 10 # m/s
A = 1 # m^2
kg_1h = v*A*kg_vol*60*60
print (kg_1h*dens / 1000.0, 'MWh')
```

Gasoline

1 gallon is 2.56 kg. In Europe the gasoline price is about 9 dollar
per gallon, or 3.51 dollar / kg.

Gasoline has a density of 32 MJ/L. 

H2

1 kg has energy of 39.7 kWh (143 MJ).

At 500 bar, 33 kg H2 /m3.

At 350 bars density is 28 kg/m3.

Liquid hydrogen has a density of 8 MJ/L.

Personal Consumption

10 KW / person, based on first world standards.

Typical energy requirements of household items

Single burner electric stove: 1500 Watts
TV: 80-400 Watts
Fridge: 100-250 watts

HFC Cars

A Nexo tank carries 210 kWh of energy. The car can travel 756 km on a
full tank [3], the tank capacity is 6.33 kg. There are actually three
tanks, each at 10,000 psi [4].

For the Toyota Mirai, the energy capacity of the fuel-cell vehicle's 5
kilograms of hydrogen, compressed at 10,000 psi, is more than 150
kilowatt-hours [5]. Max range 500 km, 1848 weight, 

```python
F = 1.848*200
w = (F*500*1000) / 3600.
print ( w / (150*1000) )
```

Solar panels

Sun energy falling on Earth 

1000 W/m2

Solar panel efficiency is 20%

Electrolysis

Current best processes for water electrolysis (PEM or alkaline
electrolysis) have an effective electrical efficiency of 70–80%,
producing 1 kg of hydrogen requires 50–55 kW⋅h of electricity
[1]. 

Ammonia

11 MWh/ton ammonia can be generated by renewable energy, solar, tidal,
or wind. "Crackers" that generate H2 from ammonia are about 76%
efficient [6].

Desalination

Energy consumption [2] of seawater desalination has reached as low as 3 kWh/$m^3$,

Fossil, Oil

How much solar panel space would Saudi Arabia need to produce its
crude output's equiv energy,

Production is 9.01 million barrels / day (Nov 2020).

1 Barrel of oil is 136 kg. Energy density of crude oil 158.4 Kwh/kg.

Sun energy falling on Earth 1 kW/m2, 24 KWh/m2 in a day.

Panel efficiency 20%, sunlight availability 50% (highest for SA)

```python
solar_kwh_day_m2 = 24*0.20*0.50
oil_energy_day = 136 * 9.01 * 1e6 * 158.4
area = (oil_energy_day / solar_kwh_day_m2)
print ("area of %0.2f km^2" % (area / 1e6))
print ("square with one side %0.2f km" % (np.sqrt(area) / 1000.0))
```

```text
area of 80873.76 km^2
square with one side 284.38 km
```

An area 290 km x 290 km. of panels. SA Rub' al Khali desert is 650,000
km^2, 1/7th of that is needed approximately.
