# Space Exploration Goals, Human Colonization

### Venus

Venus is relatively close, has the right gravity and in its upper
atmo, with extra engineering, can be made livable.

### O'Neill Cylinders

Informative tweet storm on the subject

<blockquote width="340" class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So today we&#39;re talking about O&#39;Neill Cylinders! Space settlements have always been something straight out of sci-fi, but cool to talk about nonetheless. Today, I&#39;m going to talk about what exactly are O&#39;Neill cylinders, and what their capabilities consist of. ðŸ˜Ž <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/scicomm?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#scicomm</a> (1/21) <a href="https://t.co/Kain29GDJN">pic.twitter.com/Kain29GDJN</a></p>&mdash; Joalda Morancy (@solarrsystem) <a href="https://twitter.com/solarrsystem/status/1275214154090123266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Good thing abt them, Earth-like gravity can be generated on them, and
they can be built close to Earth. 

Bezos talked about it at length at a presentation (apparently he was
once one of O'Neill's students)
