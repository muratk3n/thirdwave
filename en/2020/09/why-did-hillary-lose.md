# Why Did Hillary Lose (2016)?

There is a double curveball on this answer.

First curveball; Bad campaigners don't lose primarily because they are
bad campaigners. They lose because they end up getting the nomination
in unfavorable times for their party, when the shinier candidates sit
it out. (Least) bad candidate wins then, and naturally fails to turn
it around with already an immense disadvantage going in (W for 2000 is
an exception). What defines good or bad times? The three variables of
*Time for Change*; economy, one-term incumbency for the party (are ppl
tired of you?), popularity of the incumbent.

Hillary, not a stellar campaigner, had the nomination during a bad
time (Obama popularity, economy were all meager). Mitt, MccCain, Dole,
are all in the same category, ineffective national campaigners who
ended up with the nomination, McCain after disastrous W for example.

So we could easily blame Obama for the fuck-up.

But here is the second curveball; Obama's popularity was low, but
Hillary, and in the larger sense, Clintonism had something to do with
that. Bama 1st term was entirely Clintonite IMO, if we go by
SecState's, first was Hillary, second is Kerry, first had war in Libya,
second had piece with Iran. Rahm, Summers were in the first, gone in
the second.

Then the conclusion is Clintonism partially doomed Obama, the dirt
spilled on Hillary who went on to lose the election. It was fitting in
a way, poetic justice, Clintonism sinking a Clinton.
