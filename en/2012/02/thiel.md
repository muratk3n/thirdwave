I think the advanced economies of the world fundamentally grow through technological progress, and as their rate of progress slows, they will have less growth. This creates incredible pressures on our political systems. I think the political system at its core works when it crafts compromises in which most people benefit most of the time. When there’s no growth, politics becomes a zero-sum game in which there’s a loser for every winner. Most of the losers will come to suspect that the winners are involved in some kind of racket. So I think there’s a close link between technological deceleration and increasing cynicism and pessimism about politics and economics.

I respectfully disagree. Thiel's model is elegant, but wrong. There are technological advances, in fact lots of it. The problem is that our current political structure is built for an fossil-steel era and it is so out of touch with the new societal structure which races forward based on the new generation of technology that it cannot deal with the present realities anymore. Looking at 70s and 80s is a shortsighted view. You need to look at 1800s, 1900s, and at the critical juncture on 1956.

Oh by the way, here's a question: why the f-k did Paypal block payments to Wikileaks?

Liberterian my ass.
