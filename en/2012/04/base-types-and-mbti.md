# Base Types and MBTI

We are investigating the relationship between base types and how they effect MBTI results. We are able to determine, along with blood type characteristics anywhere between 10 and 20 base attributes for anyone. Our theory is that these base types combine, or compete in various ways to form the dominant shape of someone's character. By dominant type we mean the four letter MBTI type. That is the end goal.

We are able to go from base to MBTI using a statistical tool as well, but that only works using correlations, using similarities of people with known base attributes and MBTI types. For example if in our records we have many Leave the Child Behind types who end up as sensors (the S in an ESTP), then stat tool can give that conclusion more weight. What we prefer, intead, is to analytically reach a conclusion without relying on data, only using it to approve or disprove our theory.

One idea we are toying with is that the base type, especially major ones such as LTCB, or Hesitant Creators define the first key schism in a person's character, the split between dominant and inferior. E.g. there is a base type called Under the Spotlight, who needs to take the center stage, be individualistic, take risks, and avoid their tendency to always trying to fit in. The act of fitting in can imply MBTI Fe, and that automatically bring in its opposite Ti. This info can be used to rule out Fi and Te from the equation for example (because Fe and Fi are never present together in the top four). Then we look at the four letter types to see which ones carry Fe and Ti. ESTP, ISFJ, ESFJ, ENFJ, and move on from there.

Example: Barack Obama is an UtS as well as an HC. Stat tool reported ESFP, we modify that, due to Fe, Ti presence, meaning an ESTP -- still an Artisan. This post made a strong case for him being an ENTP, but the data used is insufficient [1]. Bam displayed utilitarianism, and a tactical bent during his first campaign with hints of long-term vision that never materialized during his presidency. He gave people bunch of talk about hope, change, etc. but offered no action. He basically lied.

Another base type is Control Freaks -- these people need to let go of control, show empathy, support from afar, not step in and run the show, and never once have we failed to see this base type in a person and find out later that person is also a Guardian [2]. It is that clearcut. CFs usually end up ESTJ, or in milder forms, as ESFJ, ISFJs.

It is fascinating stuff. Investigation continues.

[1] The only contender in this regards is ENFJ. Fe, Ti are present in ENFJs, and Ti plays an auxillary role. Bam complained once during his 2008 campaign that "he did not have enough think time" due to his busy schedule. Ti acts as a relief for ENFJs. Also UtS craving for identity can translate into Idealist's need for identity, plus blood type B/AB could weaken sensor abilities pushing the needle away from ESTP to ENFJ. My money is still on ESTP tho.

[2] The reverse is not necessarily true. That is, CF implies SJ, but SJ does not always imply CF.
