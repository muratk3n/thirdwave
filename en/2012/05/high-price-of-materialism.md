# The High Price of Materialism

BTW, Marx was also a materialist, so the message above is not
necessarily anti-capitalist, or against free markets. Marx looked down
on white-collar work and even jokingly called it "unproductive". A
materialist mentality is defined by limited resources, limited people
which implies allocation, and its direct consequence reallocation, of
wealth, land, status, etc. This line of thought is increasingly out of
touch with the unlimited nature of the knowledge age that emphasizes
creativity, gives many options for trial (and error), and requires
-demands- asynchronicity, decentralization, and variety.
