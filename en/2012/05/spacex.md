For the first time in history, a private corporation is set to prove it can
deliver cargo to the International Space Station. At the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., a Falcon 9 rocket belonging to Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), is being prepared to place its Dragon spacecraft into orbit on a test mission to the orbital outpost [..].

The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk to revolutionize space transportation in order to eventually make it possible for people to live on other planets. Today, SpaceX is advancing the boundaries of space technology through its Falcon launch vehicles and Dragon spacecraft.

The company’s prototype rocket, Falcon 1, was the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit. The more powerful Falcon 9 rocket debuted with back-to-back successful flights in June and December of 2010. The December flight included the first flight of the Dragon spacecraft, and SpaceX again made history by becoming the first commercial company to send a spacecraft to orbit and return it safely to Earth – a feat previously accomplished by three nations, the United States, Russia and China.
