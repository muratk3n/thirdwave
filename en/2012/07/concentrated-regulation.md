# Concentrated Regulation
The problem is now there are way too many disconnected, distributed actors in the scene, gaining importance because of technology (not globalization). Backward-ass shit system can do its thing, but when they involve such forces (people) into their fold, not only as customers but stakeholders, than all hell can break loose.

It is impossible to regulate such diverse forces through concentrated means. This is the root of the problem.
