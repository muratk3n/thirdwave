# Learning by Watching
These are all micro messages that student can absorb like a sponge, if he is standing next to the teacher and watching. This is a very important part of learning, and teaching.

ButÂ  obviously, since one has to be there physically, this approach cannot scale, or we want it to scale better. Maybe a new tool can be created to have people transmit their work habits; a combination of self video recording, desktop and keyboard capture, etc. I saw recently a venture capitalist (whose background is in tech) enabled his editor so all his previous drafts for his writings can be seen, along with all mistakes, trials, do-overs. This is nice. It gives people access to his thinking process.
