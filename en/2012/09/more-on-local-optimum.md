# More on the Local Optimum
LIFE is a complex problem, in this setting individuals could be seen as  "local solvers" whose starting positions are scattered, and different. This is why pluralism is important, multiple viewpoints should matter, multiple companies, multiple enterprises, even multiple efforts inside the same company need to exist so they can all climb various different hills, each trying to find the optimum point.

In history, civilizations, cultures can find themselves being stuck at various local maximums. Roman Empire climbed one  and got stuck. Ottoman Empire found itself at another and collapsed. It takes a man to recognize one is stuck at a local optimum, and decide to climb down, and start the climbing that other hill.
