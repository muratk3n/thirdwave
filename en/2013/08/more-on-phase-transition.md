# More on Phase Transition
Others in the "big explanation" category include Bruce Bueno de Mesquita (who interestingly looks like a Bruce but not like a de Mesquita) - and his Predictioneer's Game book. BBM uses Game Theory for political, policy predictions. He certainly got some game (no pun indended), however, it needs to be stressed that BBM analyzes political systems in isolation, in other words his focus is The Integrators and their particular method of horse trading within closed boundaries, within the old system. His most recent work investigatesÂ  how rulers "buy" influence so he started looking at money flows (will Assad stay in power? does he have cash? where does it come from? etc).

The problem is that events such as Arab Spring, the wants of the people, and the major of effect of technology are not added into this calculation. I have a rough idea about the math and data structures he uses, all actors being analyzed must fit into neat rows and columns with their wants / dislikes / influence. Major shifts, major lifestyle changes are not part of this scheme (maybe the method could be extended to do that, but that's another topic). 

The Long Tail, Linchpin, Free are moving in the right direction, in that they try to envision, prepare for the upcoming (if not already here) post-industrial world, the next phase, and how marketing, sales, work can take place in this environment. We need more books like these because if we can chart this yet-unknown future partly, we can minimize black swans, the tipping points, the what-nots that will be on the way.
