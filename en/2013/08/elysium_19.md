# Elysium
But no, the movie had to make the hero "working class", so he could suffer an accident "at the factory" and Elysium residents as rich, arrogant types (with healthcare), that's why the sci part of scifi had to be thrown out the window. Doesn't anyone with an ounce of brain knows that there will be no assembly line workers in the future?

Plus, if there is a "med bed" techology (some near-magical tech that cures you no matter what), everyone would have access to that technology. Why shouldn't they? What does it run on? Gold dust? 

Who churns out this shit thinking it's scifi?
