# Inventions of the Kebabic Kind

What is this urban legend about Berlin being the birthplace of
*döner*? This is simply not true. I could not believe my ears when I
heard of this.. Even this article, with its big title admits " [a]
club-shaped piece of meat cut by hand from a vertically turning spit
goes back more than 100 years in Turkey". People in TR believe the
birthplace as the city of Bursa, and the exact year is claimed to be
as [1867](http://iskender.com.tr/iskenderin-tarihi.html).

Serving it as fast food might have been the invention here, or maybe
Berlin was the first major European city to serve the dish in many
outlets. Who knows. But the invention of döner (meaning 'it
turns').. Likely not. Greek gyro, Arabic shawarma, or Armenian tarna
(literally means to turn) are all variations of the same idea that
were served all over the place in Eastern Europe and Middle East, for
a long time. Someone needs to set the record straight.
