# Inventions of the Kebabic Kind

What is this urban legend about Berlin being the birthplace of doner?
This is simply not true. I could not believe my ears when I heard of
this actually.. Even this article, with its big title admits " [a]
club-shaped piece of meat cut by hand from a vertically turning spit
goes back more than 100 years in Turkey". Serving it as fast food
might have been the invention here, or maybe Berlin was the first
major European city to serve the dish in many outlets. Who knows. But
the invention of doner (meaning 'it turns' in Turkeze).. I dont think
so. Greek gyro, Arabic shawarma, or Armenian tarna (literally means to
turn) are all variations of the same idea that were served all over
the place in Eastern Europe and Middle East, for a long time. I love
the city of Berlin, it's just.. someone needs to set the record
straight.
