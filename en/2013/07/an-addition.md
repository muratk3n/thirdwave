# An Addition

Another confirmation of the MBTI groupings we mentioned here: ESTP Erdogan idolizes ISTP Putin.

Putin: "One should never fear threats. It's like with a dog. A dog senses when somebody is afraid of it, and bites. The same applies [with humans]. If you become jittery, they will think that they are stronger."

Putin: "Only one thing works: Go on the offensive. You must hit first, and hit so hard that your opponent will not rise to his feet."

Hillarious.
