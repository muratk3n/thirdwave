# Some Type Findings
ESTP comedian idolizes ESTP Eddie Murphy, ESFP Bill Clinton idolizes ESFP Kennedy, NTP Bam INTP Lincoln, ESTP Erdogan ISTP Putin, INTJ Zuckerberg INTJ Gates. There is a band of INTJ economists who hang on "The Master" Keynes for dear life, who was an INTJ. Ditto for Greenspan and Ayn Rand (Marx apparently was also an INTJ). 

A related note: the theoretical bent of the INTJs appears to be not too strong. Or rather INTJ has a way of cutting off information (empirical evidence, more cases) at certain point and declare the theory "done", and avoid pursuing it further. The intuitive function of INTJs, Ni, can be surprisingly convergent too - 
intuition's job is to "exercise" different routes, options, projecting 
to future, and in this case, it tends to "conclude". This is good and bad, good it can lead to "products" easier, bad in that they will not pursue theory to its ultimate conclusion, failing to see its eventual success or collapse. There is a reason why Quantum Mechanics and Relativity enjoys two NTPs as their main figure - Feynman and Einstein.

Opposites

Adolf Hitler is marked as INFJ. Winston Churchill was an ESTP, meaning these two characters were exact opposites.

This must helped  Churchill fighting H, and it cannot be stressed enough how important that was and how crucial a figure Churchill has been in turning things around during WWII. Drucker says, until Churchill

"[..] Hitler had moved with apparent infallibility. After Churchill, Hitler was “off” for good, never regaining his sense of timing or his uncanny ability to anticipate every opponent’s slightest move. The shrewd calculator of the thirties became the wild, uncontrolled plunger of the forties. It is hard to realize today, thirty years after the event, that without Churchill the United States might well have resigned itself to Nazi domination of Europe and of the still largely intact colonial empires of Europe. Indeed, even Russia might well not have resisted the Nazi invaders had not Churchill, a year earlier, broken the Nazi spell" [1].

So here is a great STPs figure!  But let's not forget after the war the electorate dispensed with Churchill quite swiftly. :) Here are some C quotes from


"You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life." [stressing courage]



"Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities." [again]

Other INFJs?  Osama Bin Laden, Ayetollah Khoemeini, Noam Chomsky (and current TR sec state Ahmet Davutoglu). This type can sense people related events, possibilities through Ni-Fe, inspiring others, diplomacy is a good occupation for them, however due to weak Ti they can also get quite delusional. My favorite in  this bunch is Mahatma Gandhi.  

Intuition

Saw few old episodes of Star Trek Voyager which ended at 2001. In one episode, someone says "Vulcans lack intuition (becauses they rely on logic all the time)". In another episode, a Borg character (who becomes human, improved) is blamed for the same. In another, a Vulcan and some other happy, smiley creature merge, by accident, biologically (hey it is scifi), and this combined dude becomes more smarter, and someone says "because the new dude uses intuition better".

It is apparent a lot of scifi writers in US did not have the slightest idea on what  intuition was. Vulcans in ST are Rationals therefore, by definition, they have very strong intuition. Idealists are the same way. IMO, ST Voyager writers equated intuition with being silly, relaxed, being a "shoot the shit kind of guy" which fits into US cultural tug-of-war btw containing self and letting go, but unfortunately (for them) has no connection to reality.

The research on this issue is vast. I followed the thread starting from Ghazali, down to Immanuel Kant, and, it is apparent in his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant is simply talking about intuition,  he just could not name it then [2]. Jung finally resolved this issue which was subsumed  into MBTI.

While reading these older texts though, I cannot help but think how much ahead we are now, and how the divisions, a lot of  labels used by these people are such pure nonsense. This is what progress must be like, nowadays  intutition, the mind, the intellect is discussed on average Internet forums.
